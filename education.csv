I re-downloaded the app because I really wanted to pick up another language  and get my revenge for giving up years ago. Once I downloaded the app  my old profile didn’t work. Saying my account info was not recognized. Not a big deal because of how little a tried when I had the app years ago. I’ve had the app for about 4 months now. One thing I noticed is that they now have a “heart meter.” Turns out that if you get enough of the lessons wrong  you lose your hearts and can’t continue until you  guess what... pay  or wait for the “heart meter” to regenerate. Not too happy to see that the app will limit your progress based on what you’re willing to spend  and how many mistakes you make. Quite a bit of a let down. Fun fact: if you decide to quit one of the lessons half way though  for any reason  you lose a heart. The app still helps with my learning  which is great  but it is very frustrating to see my progression limited halted because of the limiters. Mistakes are bound to happen  just doesn’t seem right that I can’t continue because of them. Would still recommend the app  but just be aware it may take you longer.

You start out learning like a kid and then it teaches you the correct usage when you’re dying to know anyway. This is beautiful and well thought out.  If you’re an adult I recommend it. You will never learn a language as naturally  quickly or as easily.

"Me223312","When I began learning Dutch vocabulary with Duolingo  I never remembered it and it was never useful. They don’t explain why your answer is wrong even when it’s grammatically correct  all Duolingo is is random phrases that make no sense whatsoever with Google Translate sentences. You could simply type in “The bear eats boots” on GT and still get the same grammatical and weird phrase on Duolingo. Trash! I switched to Babbel a few months back  their grammar is explained in an easy to understand way for a 12 year old  (aka me) and their voice recognition is strict  thats a good thing because you cannot sneeze into the mic and get a green “Correct” like on Duolingo. Instead  you actually have to train your pronunciation correctly numerous times  which Babbel clearly does. And Babbel also has spaced repition flashcards  writing and speaking exercises which may be why I remember the phrases and vocabulary so well. They teach verb tenses and conjugations  acronyms and cultural stuff. Great job Duolingo  you made a trashy app! I guarentee all these Duolingo users THINK they are learning a language  but they can’t remember simple vocabulary like us Babbel users. Anyways  don’t use Duolingo  all you’ll learn is “A bear pees in a boot” or “The worm hugs the dinosaur”.","-","2","Uh no",3525720072,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id365862926",5.2.63,1

Work to your level 5’s and it’s hard to believe you’ll be typing  reading and listening in Russian (or something else) in no time.

"Jackryan15","Duolingo is really fun for me. I like to study languages in a game-like environment rather than studying. There are some problems  though. On the app  with the new update  you cannot skip to level 2  3  4  or 5. You can only skip to the first level. If I go onto the website so I can skip to a level  it glitches and freezes until I force quit Safari. Also  the Duolingo website has more content than the app. The website allows you to delete languages or restart them. It also lets you skip to different levels as mentioned above. Also  when you select a new course  you get a full description of your language and the names of the contributors. The app doesn’t have this; however  the user interface is more pleasing on the app  and the app is less glitchy. When I use it  I alternate between the website and the app. This does help me learn languages  though. Overall? I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language for free.

That and when you want to get more gems to spend. The ads that do come up automatically don’t interrupt anything because they come up after you complete each lesson.

When I upgraded to an iPhone and downloaded the app  Duolingo had changed the format of the app in an attempt to force people to the paid app. By adding a health element to the game that when it runs out you either have to stop playing  or “pay to play” so to speak. It’s just not enough for the app creators that you are using the “free” app  they were adds between every completed section  they now want to annoy users into buying the complete app. Well good job Duolingo  I’m annoyed.

"Living Comfort Eagle","You can learn a LOT on Duolingo. I started using it in early 2014. In 2015 I completed the French tree. Pretty cool.   Since then  how how the app changed?  - Lingots doubled and turned blue in the app (they’re called gems now)  but not on the website   - they added cartoony drawings with no educational impact   - there are obnoxious ads now  - they added scripted chats. These are kind of forced and unnatural  but at least you can see the idea of trying to practice conversation. (Update: I think these are gone now)  - They made it impossible to learn a lot in one day without paying money thanks to the bs health meter meaning you can’t make mistakes while learning a language you don’t know (???!!!)  - It got buggier   - The fonts got less readable and they took away landscape orientation   What has NOT changed?  - practice sessions are still incredibly dumb. as I said  I completed the tree  but when I practice  Duolingo thinks I should drill “cats” and “dogs” and “men who are calm and rich” for the thousandth time instead of  say  imperative commands  materials  and advanced grammar.   - there’s still not much point to having Lingots or Gems  although you can buy them now   - some practice questions are really awkward  dumb  or repetitive. These do not appear to have been improved at all. Fresh drill content would be nice.   - Medium green on light green text is still used for minor correction messages  which is nearly impossible to read for many people and in many situations. Accessibility matters  Duolingo!  - Lesson or chat progress is still lost if the app is ejected from memory. Apps should restore state on relaunch according to Apple’s guidelines.   - It now crashes. It never used to crash in the old days. Now Duolingo will crash on random question submissions. Then you have to start from scratch or go use a computer. This has now been a sporadic issue for me for a year or more. I’m on a reasonably recent iPhone  too!  Duolingo remains a good way to start learning a language  but the value drops off fast once you have learned how to say “the cats are eating fish.”  UPDATE: I am removing a star due to how completely obnoxious the ads and design have gotten. And with the crazy bugs  this app no longer deserves more than one star. For shame.","-","1","Buggy. CRASHY. Annoying. Low-contrast.

"Thorny Bear","This is the best app for learning a new language  it starts out nice and slow but you can get a hang of it pretty quickly. The ads aren’t intrusive and the lessons are well put together; but I have some issues. Paid membership is perfectly fine but the tests are too expensive  especially if the lessons are so repetitive. The first lessons for Japanese are too short  they give too little words in hiragana and moves to katakana too quickly. I miss the old “golden lesson” mechanic where I could easily tell where I was getting rusty  but the levels don’t really change the lessons. Leveling up a lesson just makes the lessons longer and doesn’t add words at a good pace  some lessons are ten questions long and only have two words to teach you. Overall if the lessons had more meat to them and tests cheaper  this would easily be a five star app.","-","3","So close...",3494040063,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id591263924",5.2.62,0

Anyone who has this app will know about that. I know you have Duolingo plus and all that but I don’t want to pay money to learn non stop.

I’ve taken classes in the past that helped me get a foundation in language learning and I was looking for something to help me keep up with what I’ve learned and build off of that  plus have the opportunity to start learning another language. Apps are more accessible than teachers  so I started looking for one that could help me make real progress other than just a few words and catch phrases. With Duolingo I’ve been able to practice speaking  writing  and listening. I love this app and I’ve recommended it to many of my friends. They make it easy to acquire “hearts” (that are lost when you make mistakes) by practicing or watching adds that help them continue to keep the app free. It doesn’t feel tedious to complete lessons or practice  they all flow nicely for me.

Every time I go on now I spend maybe five minutes because I make errors and run out of strength....I didn’t want to play a game  I wanted to LEARN and I don’t find it very easy to do that anymore.

Also  I don’t understand why you removed the language bots in Spanish. I LOVED that part of it.

"Pinkrose1422","This app helps with learning (Japanese for me) and it’s lovely. It goes over match making the Japanese alphabet (Hiragana and Katakana)  translating basic sentences or vocabulary  and has hearing practice also.   But it doesn’t tell you what you’re going to be learning. It just throws you in. There is no explanation  it doesn’t show you a chart of Hiragana or Katakana  it just throws you right into it without preparation. I know Hiragana and Katakana so I got them right  but it’s the fact it doesn’t give you any form of preparation. (I choose “Beginner” so it is fully new and I also choose the option for a placement test to see where I fit in with) and both didn’t give preparation on what you’re going into.   I wish it’ll give you lessons or at least tell you what you’re going to be learning. A simple review for it quizzing you.

"Jason D 2018","Being able to study a language at your leisure and on your time frame is a marvelous experience. I am studying French after taking 25 years off and studying Spanish at which I am already very proficient (really just to ensure that the French does not “overwrite” my Spanish). I have made a good amount of progress in French and have enjoyed it. I have found Spanish a bit more frustrating. Part of it is my fault because I try to fly through. Part of it though is the program’s low tolerance for ambiguity. It commonly views a word as having one translation and does not accept other answers  but the answer that it accepts changes.   For example  “Mi novia no conoce a mucha gente”. I would translate as my fiancé (or girlfriend) does not know (or does not meet) many (or a lot) of people. Which one of the original words would be correct or incorrect?  All of them. It doesn’t matter. When I choose one of the possible translations  the other one is almost always correct. Given that there are many combinations and which one the program chose would change  it was almost impossible to guess correctly. I chose “many”  but the program chose “a lot”. The next time I would choose “a lot ” but the program chose “many!”  My “health” dwindled to nothing and I was forced to stop. My son had a similar experience with French. I  however  don’t know enough in French to see the ambiguities in translations.   I thought about giving it 3 stars from this  but the good is so amazing that it outweighs the frustrating bad.","+","4","It’s great but…",3475993441,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30735920",5.2.61,0
"Fulcrum Rex","Duolingo is a fantastic app! I started using it a while back to learn German and it’s been super helpful  easy to use and fun! However one other language I have always wanted to learn is Latin! I learned some of it back when I was in school. As a Catholic  Latin is a big part of the mass at certain churches so I also learned some there as well. But I never got past a certain point with the language. I only learned a few short sentences and various nouns and verbs. It would be a dream come true if Duolingo could work on adding this! I find the app to be extremely helpful. In fact I would go as far as to say that I have probably never had a more efficient language teacher than this app!  I know Latin is a dead language  but it’s a beautiful one  and is actually still used in many writings in the modern day  especially in fictional stories  such as popular books  movies  and even some video games.  Anyway  I hope Duolingo reads this and considers adding Latin to their collection!

"So many meds!","Duolingo does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. My review is strictly for Japanese as an English speaker. I have not tried the other languages.  Pros: * It has short lessons (at first) which are good for those with a busy lifestyle  and usually focusing on one concept. * Good enough of a focus on vocabulary. Lots of random words  although not too many synonyms.  Cons: * There's barely any emphasis on kanji. You simply cannot learn to read actual Japanese with Duolingo  and worse  when you try to type in kanji you happen to already know it will often mark you as incorrect! This is unacceptable. * Although it started with shorter lessons  towards the end it feels as though the lesson planners started packing in more and more concepts into each individual lesson. This makes trying to finish your daily lessons a chore and you can end up in a rolling failure where you lose all your health trying to remember that other concept you know you /just/ went over 5 questions ago. Too bad  so sad; better pay up for a health refill or you get to start all over with a practice session covering other random concepts! * There's very few lessons and after about 3/4ths of the way through they haven't covered anything but formal textbook-style speaking. Good luck talking to actual Japanese people! * After looking through the screenshots I'm surprised to see other languages have speaking lessons. There are no speaking lessons where you are corrected for pronunciation for Japanese.  Other: * It often feels like the grading is strict simply to dock you of health. Come on  typos are typos and you should be able to handle them. * I wish I could turn off the encouragements. With it always congratulating you after 5 or 10 correct answers in a row it's too regular and easy to attain  so it comes off as robotic and forced. Maybe congratulate me for hitting 100 correct answers in a row instead of 10? Or completing a lesson without any mistakes?","-","3","Review of Japanese",3468234877,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id424483497",5.2.61,0

The current gamification for someone brushing up is an incredible disincentive to practicing. When my phone autocorrects words as I hit enter and I accidentally bump the wrong key on the train I’m basically left having to wait hours for accidents instead of practicing.  Waiting 4 hours to continue learning when I have 30 minute commute is terrible. I’m not saying they shouldn’t get paid but the balance is completely off on the gem for health feature. Earning 13 gems for hitting my target for the day  when paying 350 to refill my health at means I have to play for a month before I can refill my health gauge once and that assumes I even get 12 or 13 since the number of gems is random.","-","1","New features are awful",3462892999,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id137211887",5.2.61,1

Sure you can practice to get it back  but the practice is always the simplest ones and are always things hat I remember and it just gets repetitive  whereas I could’ve just kept going with my original lesson.

"LaLaKyla","Just taking the placement test for Japanese  I’m seeing QUITE a few issues.  The pronunciation of the Kanji is wrong  for starters. 日曜日 (にちようび or nichiyoubi) was pronounced “ひようび or hiyouhi”. If I didn’t already know this  then I would have thought Sunday was pronounced COMPLETELY wrong.  Additionally  major  MAJOR pillars in Japanese are skipped in sentences. The major pillars I am referring to are PARTICLES. imagine staying in English “Kyla’s chair that she is sitting on is blue” as “Kyla chair she is siting is blue”.  Don’t worry  there’s more. Whole words are wrong and it isn’t possible to have multiple answers when sentence structure is ambiguous.  Least importantly  because at this point I’m just being picky  I don’t see why their programming isn’t to the point that it can sound like a Japanese person is speaking  when sentences are being said. Why does it sound like google translate? That’s just simple programming laziness.","-","1","How is it possible for one app to be so wrong  so consistently?",3459405360,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id932748444",5.2.61,0

"Rachel.Luvs.Cookies","Okay  so I’ve been using Quizlet for quite a while and it’s been helping me a lot. I always found it hard to study a paper when the answers were literally right on it. I also have the worst memory  so Quizlet’s “Learn” option repeats the questions and it helps me tremendously. Though  there are some... problems that should be fixed.   1. First of all the studying options are limited on the phone  mainly because I can’t create diagrams using a phone  so I have to get on a laptop which takes more time that I don’t have.  2. Though I am paying for Quizlet Plus  I do agree with everyone else that you should at least make the night theme free. Some people have a hard time reading words in a bright background  especially at night. I wear glasses and can read words with a bright background  but it’s really not healthy for the eyes.  3. When I’m studying I come across typos and I find it quite annoying when I have to go to the editing mode. It’d be easier if you could access the editing mode right there so it’ll be quick.   — Recommendations 🍡 I think that  when you guys get the chance  you should add more modes to learn though. Honestly? You could turn Quizlet into an optional game that has currencies  shops  etc! I think that would definitely motivate people to study more! Not only that  but it helps the forests!

"BigKidEL","Concept is great  love that it has audio feature  but have found buggy and needs improvements. I often find I need to abandon using quizlet for my accounting classes and foreign language studies  as there are not enough features and proves to be too clunky snd cumbersome.  1 Phrase or word disappears each time when click on + sign to add next card  leaving only the definition or translation side of card. End up with one side blank on cards. This problem is with iPhone app. Needs to be fixed.  2 Cards for foreign language learning do not allow to mute your native language  when only want to hear one side of card limiting the audio to just the new language being studied. Only want to see definition in English  but not hear it. Am forced to listen to both sides with iPhone app. No setting to mute just one side of card when studying.  3.  Cards cannot be set up with foot notes or long text  making Quizlet only suitable for short entries  very much like kindergarten cards. Would like more design options  with easy to insert features and images  such as a way to show an entire accounting problem.  4. Need to add a full spreadsheet style format instead of only index cards for when have 1000+ terms  as is common with foreign language studies  complete with audio button to click on the sheet to hear the term or sentence  and a feature to hide or display the column of definitions. A long continuous scroll would be useful  not paginated and perhaps with side tabs to quickly get to parts of the scroll  like A-Z tabs or customizable marker tabs.  5.  Need better ways to move cards into separate sets and reorganize  combine and separate.","-","2","Needs a lot of improvements",3466794512,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id205523352",4.6,2

Here are some quick suggestions to consider:  -combining sets was so helpful  I’m not sure if the option is still available on the computer but it isn’t on my phone... needs to come back!  -the “supscription” is something I wish didn’t exist — I know you want to make money but for some of us that don’t want to pay the free version makes us not like the app...  -color!! Blue gets so boring after a while — color  highlighter etc. would totally make your app get higher ratings!  -I think a cool addition would be something like where we can take a picture of an essay/document and “highlight” on our phones and write little “post it’s” that when you click on it  it expands and shows your writing.  -being able to change our username more than once...

"VictoriaSilvis","I have low grade in Psychology currently. Since I’m not fan of flash cards because I am not sure how effective or efficient they are to use as various way to study for quiz  exam or standardized tests.   I’ve been making flash card sets for few weeks  and I feel surprisingly pleased and impressed with Quizlet. Please keep on running Quizlet forever and ever. These are great studying tool for students who are self studying or studying for any particular subject  major  quiz or standardized test.   Also  I am unsure how using Quizlet as study tool will impact on my grades though. There are other things I have to work on other than just studying. Like getting good night rest because I’m like Dracula so I may have adjust my sleep habits  reduce screen time and rest and relax. I do have a good feeling my grade will boost if I just continue quizzing myself continuously using Quizlet when I’m on the bus  at home or anywhere.   Quizlet is perfection! Oh by the way I notice your subscription is absolutely affordable  since I’m unemployed college student in community college with a disability. I do not have the money but I love to some day try an affordable subscription just to not necessarily study vocabulary words. Yet create my own practice tests so I can put myself to the test.

"TitoBeeto😜","I am a seventh grader at a pretty advanced school that kind-of pushes you to do most things on your own  so this app REALLY helps me when I need to study for a test. I absolutely LOVE the fact that the app can form a practice test out of the terms and definitions that you fill out  it is SO helpful! The only thing that I kind-of find annoying is how  when I’m taking a practice test  I will answer the question correctly but I might leave something lowercase or uppercase and it says that I got the answer wrong. I don’t know if it does that to anyone else  but it does to me and it’s a bit annoying. Although  it probably is kind-of hard to program an app to be able to understand that the answer was correct  even if it wasn’t spelled exactly the same. Other than that  it’s a great app I wish I had heard about it sooner.","+","5","Get this app!",3310536529,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id563607800",4.3,0

"Jay Trades","First off  I love Quizlet. But there are some aspects that are lacking that could easily be implemented into the program.   1. Folders need to be able to have sub-folders. This will make things less messy and more organized for the user.   2. Manual sorting of sets in both folders and classes. Again  we need to keep things orderly (for those who want it). It’s about ease of access to find what you want when you want it.   3. The option to add a “card” being 1 term with its definition to your own set — so that you don’t have to a) re-type everything and b) don’t copy the set   These things  especially points 1 & 2 should be fairly easy for the developers to implement. Since we the user lack these abilities that’s why i see this as a 3 Star program. Add them  and you got an easy 5 Star. Organization of ones thoughts is key. Ease of access  when you want  when you want it.","-","3","Developers can do a better job by...",3305192739,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id559719849",4.3,0

"**Honest Beauty**","I have been a Quizlet Plus subscriber for years and I like the overall concept of Quizlet. But  I found myself wasting away HOURS of time trying to compensate for poor development of the app. Many nights I would feel defeated after realizing how much time I wasted creating flashcards to be functional for my purpose.   If you are not creating flashcards  then my gripes won't pertain to you. I am a visual learner and I also thrive on order/organization. One of my BIGGEST issues with Quizlet is the formatting! I have literally thrown my papers in the air out of frustration lol They seriously need to work on the way the system autoformats the text. It centers things based on the number of characters and this is sooooo annoying! There needs to be an option to leave formatting starting from the Left  regardless of character count; because  things dont look right centered on many cards and everyone learns differently. It completely throws off the purpose of a card to highlight key things quickly. Please fix this issue! Please! Another issue is the Bold option for words. They seriously need to come up with a better way to Bold words instead of having to type * before and after the word/phrase to bold! Its time consuming and wasteful. A Bold button would be a nice feature to add to the web version for starters. Also  bolding terms gets more irritating due to the issue with formatting everything to the Center! Once you Bold a word w/in a sentence etc. Since the system wants to center everything  you are likely to have text wrapping around to a 2nd sentence because of the size adjustment with Capitalizing and Bolding. Additionally  the Bold feature isn't really Bold! Lol its not bright enough to really stand out. I find myself having to Capitalize and Bold a word for it to stand out!   Another formatting gripe is the lack of option to indent or create bullets  numbered values. Again  since everything wants to be Centered  it throws off any kind of list  unless you create something long and at that point the system reverts back to formatting the flashcard from the Left! Its irritating. Another formatting issue lol is the "Math/Symbols" language option. I love having this as an additional keyboard/language for creating cards  but the way it takes over so much of the screen with it's drop down window is annoying.   The study modes need severe work. If you create folders  you can study a different way (which I prefer the way where you hit Know or Don't Know)  but that progress is separate from the "Learn" option within a particular set! Its so crazy. So now I have to create folders with ONE set inside of them  in order to get both study options ( the Know/Don't Know version vs. Learn). Additionally when studying  the system automatically puts your cards on "definition" first. Its annoying to have to change this for every set! Why not have a preference button that applies to our user profile and/or per each set/folder and that way we don't have to constantly adjust settings to have the "term" side show first! Notable mentions of other irritating features: 1) the search feature ( I thought search meant search your OWN terms or sets to find duplicate cards)  but nope! It will search the galaxy and beyond lol 2) Editing sets should be easier 3) image uploads are great  but possibly being able to crop or edit the image better would be nice  also adding images to the term side would be highly delightful.   A huge "no no" for me is the numerous times I have been creating cards on the actual site (vs importing a document) and this new auto search feature they added kicks in 🙄! Annoying! If I type in a word  it will search Quizlet and pull up suggestions already on Quizlet or the internet...the issue with this is  sometimes when typing  when you hit "return" to skip to a new line  it will erase your content and insert whatever quizlet  search found. I despise it! Turn it off or allow users to turn off the quacky suggestion feature. I have had to retype stuff so much! Wasted hours  which could have beeb used elsewhere.   I love the Diagram feature. However  I hate the set up. If you label something on the diagram  it gives you the same "term" & "definition" fields. This is great if you indeed need a definition  but if you simply just want to label parts  let us label it and thats it. I hate how you create a diagram and they treat it like a flashcard set! Why not have an option for it to just be a diagram set of labelling parts and thats it?!   All in all  Quizlet has a great platform and potential. But I think the developers are focused on the wrong aspects and not functionality. Because the basics of the app are lacking  but new flashy features keep getting added and it takes away from the potential! I would say Quizlet is great for the following: you are not making your own cards; you are learning simple 1-2 word terms; you don't need formatting/order/neatness; you don't need to study high level topics; you have lots of time to spare for creating personalized functional cards; and if you don't require better study tactics. I love the app  once the cards are made and functional. But I despise the process of creating flashcards on their platform. I am a Plus subscriber  but due to the frustration  I have had to look elsewhere for other apps to see if they have better formatting options. Sometimes its the small things that distract a student from learning and Quizlets formatting features affect visibility and productivity for those with learning issues  vision issues  higher level education (complex material)  and those with things like OCD/OCPD  ADHD etc who require order.","-","3","Great app  but needs better development",3267318693,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id119916104",4.2,0

"Heartbroken👨","I’ve been using quizlet for over 8 years now and it’s been helpful overall  until now.  The learning feature on the app makes no sense. You’re instantly quizzed over material  which you may or may not actually know  so you’re basically just guessing random questions— which might help you learn if it’s your native language  but if you’re trying to use the cards for learning a new language  it is completely useless. They should change the title to something else like review quiz or under the quizzes/test section. Because it’s not actually helping you learn if you have 50 plus flash cards in a language you don’t know.  They also need to make an offline version available. I’m a commuter and I haven’t been able to access my cards to study on the way to class just because the cards aren’t available offline. But when I try to see how to make it offline  I can’t find an actual solution to my issue.  It’s a good app. But there’s like small issues that make it basically useless.","-","3","After years of use  it still needs improvement",3249130495,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id343299381",4.2,0

They like to use Quizlet as a weapon against me also. As well as my toxic mother and anyone else who wants to see me suffer in school. I think the app is fine. I think it is very successful but people take advantage. It’s hard struggling in school and having to do 8 lessons for 5 hours on Quizlet I just don’t want people to be able to use this app as a weapon against others and I think there should’ve been some sort of security system for the app. To organize maybe classes for teachers and their students. I think these classes should have security and only people invited to a class are allowed to study there. I also think that if a student is studying in a class for over an hour and they are doing fine the whole time that they should be kicked off the lesson to give them a well needed break.

"dj dcypher","Quizlet is amazing  but I have a problem with the test function. When I finish studying and go to take a practice test  if I have one typo in the answer  then it counts it wrong. For instance  say I’m studying for a math test  and the definition of dimensional analysis comes up  but I accidentally leave out one letter and spell it “dimensionl analysis”. I knew what the answer was  but I still got it wrong because I left out the “a”. I don’t know if there is a way to fix this  but it’s a pain to go back and make sure that I spelled everything right before I submit the answer. I still love the app  but for me  I can’t stand that spelling counts on the test because I wouldn’t be able to type anything without autocorrect. The autocorrect function is disabled when you are studying and taking a test  and you could know the answer but get it wrong because you misspelled it.","+","4","I love Quizlet  but having no autocorrect is definitely a con to this amazing app",3182978768,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33459156",4.0,0

"Wannabe polyglot😉","I am in 9th grade and I have been using Quizlet for more than a year now. In 7th grade I made flash cards by hand for Latin. By the end of the year  I had a six inch thick stack of cards! They all got crumpled and torn. With Quizlet  everything is perfectly organized. I can’t lose them like real cards.   I used this app to study Spanish over the summer so that I could go straight to Spanish 2. I passed the exam with an A  and this is the only app I used to study vocabulary.   Useful features: -multiple study modes -copying decks -folders that hold multiple decks -SHARING WITH FRIENDS (so useful!) -free (unless you want extra features  which are not required)  Improvements: -there should be a feature for combining decks. I made a deck for each chapter of my Spanish textbook  and now I want to be able to combine them all into a giant deck to study all at once. Since this feature doesn’t exist  I have to completely remake 600+ cards. PLEASE MAKE A COMBINE FEATURE I WOULD GIVE THE APP 5 STARS WITH A COMBINE FEATURE!!!

It has flashcards  multiple choice  matching and even foreign language voices to help you properly pronounce every entry!   I love it that we can all share Information we have entered and are studying.  I can find vocabulary and other information in just about every language I need.  I can find useful information on just about any topic too.    Quizlet has been such a blessing helping me prepare for language tests.

I like how easy it is to make sets; it's much easier than creating physical flashcards. My favorite feature is how different translations are integrated for language studies. My minor suggestions would be: 1.) Make "Private Set" the default rather than Public. 2.) In addition to reviewing cards by scrolling  add a "flip to tap" interface as another option to review the cards. It would give users the semblance of using traditional/physical flashcards. 3.) Once or twice the audio feature reads something very different from what I tried on the card (no special characters or weird spacing).

"PPYYKK","I hope the developers actually read this... First of all  I am very grateful for this tool/app. It certainly makes my life easier as a teacher with two big classes. In general  it is a very helpful tool to manage your class and students. With the addition of the ‘material’ option in classwork  it makes it really convenient to post agenda  handouts  or just information if I want to keep record of them (because the posts on the stream gets pushed down over time). However  on the app  the posts always don’t show as its complete version. The posts are always cut off below the first two lines  which makes it very inconvenient for students who use their cellphone to access more often than on a PC. Some of my students don’t have computer access everyday so it makes it really difficult and a little discouraging for them to keep up with all the information provided online  especially when they are all trying to improve their computer/ internet literacy. I truly hope this issue can eventually be resolved in the next few updates.","-","3","Great class management tool but need improvements",3314668781,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id581526666",2.2018.39208,17

With a glaring flaw...not every family let alone kid can afford The king of overpriced Apple  I really hope the school is payin for these incredibly expensive iPhones and iPads for each student!! Any kid in the class without an Apple smart device (most expensive) vs say any android or i its a Google thing...why not the more affordable GOOGLE Pixel??  If the iphones & iPads cost being thrust on the kids/parents or they’ll be unable to take the course I’m looking at you TI Instruments Scientific Calculators...smh those are already incredibly expensive for a Calc I never used for more than multiplication and division... that’s putting the student at a disadvantage if his family can afford a scifi overpriced gameplaying calc and an iPhone / ipad with plan.

The app has also seen numerous bug improvements that help it to feel snappier.

However  there is a glitch with the app. When I am absent I will use the app on my iPad to go in and post an assignment to all of my classes. At school  on my laptop  I am able to make one post and post it to multiple classes at once. The app allows me to do this  but then when the students actually go to do the work  only the class I made the post in gets the post. All the others either don’t have a post or they have the post but can’t access the attached document. It’s makes a huge mess of the day because I’m not there to realize it’s happened. I figured it out cause it’s happened more than once now.

"merlinsyosi","Flanders fields was a rondeau about war  written by a soldier. Its an interesting poem because it kind of switches back and fourth between a beautiful scene of poppies in a field  to people dying in combat. The mood was kind of gloomy  made me a little sad that the nicer things in life couldn’t be appreciated because of war going on around it. We wear the mask was another saddening one  its whole focus is how people cant escape wearing the mask  and how horrible humans are for each-other. And its historical context really makes sense  because while some fought out to try and solve problems with discrimination  some hid their pain under masks to get where the got to.   Change starts within. No leopards spots Can change outside  nor change the plots. Try as you will  it must be pure.  Its your choice  it will not allure.  Changing is hard  it will cause knots  We are destined to fall  fall lots. More if something we want just rots. We see the wrong  we know the cure  Change starts within  Don’t believe me  take all your shots.  Its bound to creep into your thoughts. Even when you think your secure. Even something so so obscure.  Its back like deafening gunshots  Change starts within","-","1","Sorry",2249847404,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id579909422",2.2018.05202,1

"efilandro","TINY DISCLAIMER! I AM 11 YEARS OLD!!! I go to a catholic school  therefore there is a lot of work. My school pays for chrome books  well technically we pay for them  and so google classroom is something that is no option. In today’s society  nobody but the Amish can live without technology. So that is what our school says we need to do. They say we need to explore the great bowels of technology.   Currently it is 2:27 and I am sick with the flu. But I have assignments I need to do at home. And of course I accidentally left my lap top at school. So I can just whip out my phone and look at all of the things I need to do and BOOM!!! All done! Google classroom is a must have. Now probably no one will listen to me because I am 11  but I just finished my five page essay on American economy so HAHA!!  All in all google classroom is a must have for those who catch illnesses easily  and constantly need to access the internet.   Although I did see some problems. There is a glitch every time I go down to my ELA folder. Every time I press on it... it just takes my back to the google classroom home screen with all of my classes.

If my students need to insert a pic into a doc and do so from their phone  they can see the pic in the Google doc. But most of the time  that pic is not visible in the doc on my end when I open the same google doc from my computer. We have not figured out how to do it from the phone. Many of my students do not have computers at home.   The other inconvenient thing has to do with posting assignments. If I accidentally make an assignment with an attached doc and forget to “make a copy for each student” I am unable to edit or add it. I have to delete the whole assignment and start over. That can be time consuming if my instructions are long.   Other than these two items  it is awesome!

I’ve been waiting for an app that will give me live updates when my teachers have switch assignment information unlike other apps that’ll show you what changed when it’s too late. I’ve also been hoping to find an app that would automatically remind me when I had an assignment to finish/due. The best part about Google Classroom is I can now see for sure if I’ve done an assignment so if a teacher of mine hasn’t put in the grade yet I can show them it’s on time and that’s it’s done.

Second (and even worse) when you click on "My Talks" then choose downloads  it will show your talk as being downloaded when in fact it isn't!

This means that you will consume a lot of unplanned bandwidth when you try to view the "downloaded" talk (which may cost you a lot of money) or you won't be able to access it all all if you don't have an internet connection.

One big flaw is when I choose a video to watch and I see on the right hand side another video in “Related Talks” I’m interested to watch afterward there is no way to find it again. Every time I finish the main video the “Related Talks” have changed again and I’m not able to watch the other video I was interested in. Even more so: There is no way to add a video in “Related Talks” to your watch list. That makes actually the “Related Talks” section pointless since I can never get back and watch what was suggested to me.   Please  I would appreciated if you can make it work that the “Related Talk” videos are NOT changing every time I finish a video or add the main video to the watch list but rather that I’m able to go back and be able to watch one of the suggested videos.

It has a clean layout with a handy search function.  Talks are categorized as “featured” and “popular” . I feel surprised that it even has subtitles in various languages!  One innovative design is that it invites users to choose the length of a playlist   so that people do not need to feel bad because they cannot finish it.  Another innovation is that users can download and bookmark talks and with downloading   for some talks  users can choose to download an audio or a video one.  Very thoughtful.  The icon is clear.  It takes some time to navigate but once familiar  you will have no trouble finding “your talks”.

And YES; the horrible  heavy emotional climate we've been (barely) living thru CAN change  and we can help do it. You're helping *me* breathe a sigh of relief; trust! I'm going to take the advice I learned today from TED and reach out to someone with whom I don't see eye2eye and LISTEN to better understand their point of view and FEAR THEM  LESS. BTW  the disgust of which they speak is exactly what broke my marriage apart  so I have first hand knowledge of how corrosive that feeling is. We MUST stop treating each other like that... every person on Earth depends upon it! THANKS TED; well done! ******************* Wanna NOT waste time? Wanna learn whilst being entertained? Just wanna make smart convo at your next get-together? Search no further than TED talks... There aren't enough superlatives to describe TED the app or TED talks... Once upon a time  only the super-connected or super-brainiacs were granted access to these halls of learning and ideas. Now-fulfilling the promise of the internet making all things available to all people- TED is here and accessible to *you.* And to me... to your uncle Louis & auntie Grezelda as well. Don't miss this amazing portal to great ideas  speakers  entertainers  information  history. Speakers as diverse as Monica Lewinsky & Tony Robbins: ideas new (Multipotentialites) & old (World Peace): subjects like LIFE & DEATH. TED's got something for all seekers (both G-d & Atheism are discussed!) in a well-thought- out  well made  and well maintained app. I've got nothing to gain from this review other than to *thank* the TED folk for providing a free  easy way to continue learning new things and ideas my whole life long.

This happens even with audio only content. I typically always stream video/audio content rather than consume it through my phone. This issue makes this app basically unusable for me.  If the app could resolve this issue  it would no doubt be a 5 star app. The app is extremely user friendly. The surprise me option is ingenious and the discover menu is so well organized - I love the playlists. The radio hour option is also great for a quick listen. I would not change anything about the app except to maybe add a history tab to my talks - it would be great to look back at what I've already watched.  I will continue to look for updates to resolve this issue because this app has so much to offer.","-","2","Incredible content but app is unusable",1479795735,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id211937860",3.0.4,5

Most of my complaints center around downloading content and playing it back. After you download content  tapping that content takes you to the same page you see when visit it without downloading content. If you downloaded audio  the video will still let you play it. So  you may not realize you are streaming video on your data plan because you only downloaded the audio! So confusing! The only way I could ensure I was not using my data plan was to turn off cellular data for the TED App. That aside  I had many problems with downloaded video and audio suddenly stopping during playback and not resuming  so I had to close the content  reopen  and try to figure out where it dropped off. So frustrating! Those are the biggest issues  but they are big ones if you want to use the downloads feature.

And as the phone seems great in every other aspect I think this app needs to be tossed out and built right.   Switch to maps - the talk starts. Go back and u have to try to find where you were from the beginning      Turn the screen off to save battery power as you are only listening to the audio - same as above.   Download only the audio version then go to play that selection - you get a big blank screen with a white arrow. So you hit that arrow. 'System error' on every audio you downloaded.  So you go back to that screen and you notice a small message in the lower left corner 'play selection'. That works. Then screen display mode kicks in and you have to start all over again. Again.   Now deal with all this at 70 miles an hour.

On top of that  it really should be able to sync favorites and stuff with your TED account - this app doesn't even let you log in  which seems ridiculous for a dedicated TED app.  I could get over that if it actually works  but it totally doesn't.  Hope there's a fixing update soon because I'd love to have downloaded TED content available for my internet-less commute.","-","1","Crashes with Audio  Doesn't Sync",1358474122,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32620396",2.6.2,0

The experience I have though is somewhat negative  but I don't know if the problems lie with the app  or the setup and programming on the back end.  First experience and consequences. As I watched course videos  many times the system did not recognize that I had watched the video  though I had  and had done so many times in hope that a check mark would appear indicating I had completed this step in the course. The result was assignments were marked as overdue.  Second experience.

My first experience with Java was around 1998 or 200  when it was in its first releases  when I was using object Pascal  so I avoided Java  as I did not need the write once play anywhere (that has the run time Java). I tried it again this week  2018  nearly 20 years later  and immediately droped the course. I had to skip ahead several lessons to get into packages and source code management. For me  Java is still a mess. A principle I learned long ago is that the package that promises everything  doesn't. Simple  efficient and direct is best for robust software engineering. I am going back to Ada.","+","5","Java Programming",3311083857,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id334841236",2.7.6,0

That said  the desktop version is better than this app  which I’ve had continual problems with — crashing  things not loading  and the app incorrectly keeping track of where I am in a course when auditing it. I’ve been using other sites much more because of this (I think that speaks volumes). I have had problems with edX and Udemy but not nearly as bad as with Coursera (both online and off). If you encounter issues like I did  try the website using a desktop computer. I found that much better in many regards. The issue with Coursera not properly tracking progress when you audit a course can be worked around by keeping a browser tab open to the course page with the week you’re working on visible.

Suggestions for improvements: if optional assignments in courses could be differentiated so that the "pick up where you left off" section could skip over those if you've already started/completed assignments after those  it would save a lot of time and actually make that a useful feature. Also  instead of randomly arranging the list of enrolled courses every time the app is opened  it would be nice to have them arranged by last accessed  next assignment due  etc. to save time and make the app a little more user-friendly. Classes also tend to “jump around” while you’re on the page so that  in the time it takes to tap on a course  another one swaps places with it and you’re taken to the wrong page—very frustrating when it happens so often.

There are a few things that could be improved. As of now you can‘t take some tests on mobile  which is understandable. Sometimes the transcripts move too far up  not too terribly but I do prefer to read along while listening. Occasionally they would like you to post on forum to better bring the learners together  this in and of itself is ok  but when it initially pops up you can‘t post from that window  instead you have to close it and go to actual forum portion of app and find your thread. So far outside of these  everything in the app works great!

I have not seen a large variety of courses  so that may be the fault of the individual company or organization that made the specific course.  However  I expect Coursera to maintain a standard.  There are instances where input does not function  or malfunctions.  Irritating during quizzes.  The app does not warn the user when there is a pending update.

Quizzes sometimes have significant issues with layout  especially if options include formulas or just long text. They also don’t handle orientation change well. And after processing answer show exploding animations 2. Video player is a bit out of date. No easy way to fast forward for 10/15 seconds. changing playback speed is iterative  with no option to quickly switch back to slower rate. Please take a look at modern iOS 11 player or at YouTube player. They have all these issues solved. 3. Video’s audio stream bitrate sometimes is so low so it is impossible to understand anything. With bad network you still have to wait to precache to get better quality. So this option of super low bitrate doesn’t give much to end users  except frustration (many forum topics talk about this audio quality  but moderators provide useless suggestions to tune equalizer)","+","4","Good classes  somewhat buggy app with strange animations",2077749820,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id255245489",2.6.5,0

The class was really interesting  and while coursera is not responsible for the great quality of the lecture videos  they are responsible for providing a platform for me to access the lecture videos in the first place. And this is why I think that coursera is a brilliant app.  The actual software of the app is good  but I do think that the team responsible for the app layout needs to work on the navigation a little bit.

Then... they keep charging class after class even after you only signed up for one topic out of the entire outline. Their rules are: you pay one topic after the free trial for your certificate. Not an entire year contract  as I was beginning to get billed. I have to wait until next month to see if I am re-billed  and hope my $$ is returned for this extra month I was charged! The fine print said I would only get billed once  for the course I wanted. If I wanted to take the full outline then I'd have to pay the yearly fee  but my point is I ONLY SIGNED UP FOR ONE CERTIFICATE!!

Studying it rarely involved more than memorizing dry historical facts occasionally highlighted by a professor who brought the era to life and reminded me that individuals peopled those unsettling times.  Focus on the why behind  choices which literally determined the course of world history  is critical at this time.  Perhaps not more critical than in the past  but certainly worth deep thinking.  This is a redirection that allows a much deeper connection with the problems and solutions of past societies.  The professor is easy to follow.  His presentation is thoroughly engaging.

A few days ago I completed El Camino Primitivo here in Spain and those two minutes of sweet music brought to an emotional close what transpired internally during those 26 days of mostly solitude in the Spanish mountains.

You can't enroll in a course on mobile  even though there's no good reason for this. They pretend you can do quizzes on mobile but it's even worse than you not being able to. They tease you along and let you take half the quiz. Then they throw a question at you that references a picture or chart required to answer the question  except it fails to load. So you either forfeit the question or have to restart the quiz. You go to your computer ( assuming you have one ) and your work is gone  you have to restart the quiz.

FEEDBACK:  There's only one issue I'd like to see resolved. You can't take notes offline. You can do literally everything else offline (including review previous notes) but the blue "Save a Note" button at the bottom becomes unresponsive when in offline mode.","+","4","Seriously impressive app",1623015613,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85535944",2.4.6,0

However  I use my iPad for many tasks in Udemy and it’s definitely got some issues that I hope the dev team can address soon. It would be great to be able to run the Udemy app side by side with another app in Split View or pop the video out into PiP. This feature would be a huge advantage when writing code or notes while watching Udemy tutorial videos  etc. The other issue is to that sometimes the video numbering in a course will be incorrect in the display. It will display sometimes 2 or 3 of the same video and it can be difficult to figure out where you are in the curriculum (especially if you jump back and forth between videos).   Overall though Udemy has a great academic offering and in cases where I need the above functionality I end up reverting to their website and using Safari’s existing Split View and PiP functions.","-","3","Decent app but needs iPad Split View or PiP video function",3464290935,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id39603082",4.4.1,0

Screen would rotate 180 degrees (up side down) when you play the preview videos. Have to rotate device back and forth to “fix” the the issue. Sometimes the next video in the course would play automatically.  Other times  not. Need to restart app to restore functionality sometimes. Would also like to see it updated to support newer devices such as the 2018 iPad Pro I am using.  Would also like to see some of the functionalities such as the playback speed and captioning options made more easily accessible (e.g.  directly on the screen overlay along with the playback buttons).  I believe these functions are used often enough given the nature of the contents (i.e.  training courses) that they deserve to be in a more accessible location rather than behind another menu. I would even suggest some gesture controls for skipping backwards and forwards instead making the user try to push tiny buttons that are a miss half the time.","-","2","Bugs  Bugs and more Bugs",3429764084,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id131335151",4.4.0,2

Here are the issues 1) feature for downloading courses for offline access is very badly designed and takes a long time to download any courses 2) The size of the downloads is huge and takes up lot of space on the iPhone and other iOS devices.

For example  similar learning apps like the one from Linux Academy have very quick course download times 3) App is not very responsive.

"vaguenickname","I “downloaded” a few courses for an upcoming flight and weekend trip on my ipad and (phone as a backup).  I discovered during my flight that the ipad didn’t actually get the courses downloaded like it claimed it did.  Ended up struggling watching coding lectures on a phone screen.  Arrived at my destination with some WiFi and discovered that the ipad app is completely busted:  - It won’t show me any of my courses in the list view  no matter the filter. - I tried to delete the courses and in the settings view they appear to be gone  but when I search for a class (since the list view doesn’t display anything) they have the orange icon and the presentation mode hangs in limbo.  Won’t play the video and eventually crashes.  - force quitting the app doesn’t affect it. - doesn’t appear that the ipad app will download anything in the background.  I have to disable auto lock on the screen and let it sit with the app in the foreground to maybe get something downloaded.  - other minor UI glitches  UI responsiveness issues and crashes (mostly related to file I/O) all on iPad. - since this is a universal app  I would guess that these issues might be on the iPhone as well  but so far they have no shown themselves.

"Alex Aldair","If you’re thinking about buying them a course  make sure you review all of them from a different browser in incognito mode. The reason is the following: the first few times you enter the website you get all courses at a “limited” promo of $11.99  if you review them for a long time  looking for the best option (I have to think about it so i dont lose my money  as i did before)  their system gets this info and after you create an account it becomes like an hour and then it supposedly expires. If you go to their website from a different browser as I did on my cellphone  the promo is still there. $11.99 for anyone who doesn’t take a look. A lot of businesses like airlines apply this  but for education? Really? Pushing someone to get something that’s supposed to be enjoyable and somehow a long-term commitment. At least in Domestika the promo is real and stays like that for EVERYONE. Not recommended. I was considering it because it’s fair to pay $11.99 for content that you could get free by doing extensive research in google and youtube  and even better content. Udemy quality standards are extremely low  everyone can be an instructor. So I don’t know who would pay more than $70 for very poor content: from audio  lighting  content itself.

Pros:  - good video quality  - wide range of subjects - affordable way to learn new skills - some courses offer a certification/badge for LinkedIn  - app has performed flawlessly on iPad: launch  video stream  sound.  - frequent "discount" offers where courses are marked down - previews of course to sample before buying - courses carry over to app  on Apple TV 4 and website  Cons:  - I get more emails with offers for new courses from instructors  I have used than I would like. This can add up quick.  - like a live class some instructors can be hard to follow or ramble on more than needed  sample before purchasing  - iOS app lacks some features of the website: the ability to watch at x.75 or x1.25 speed.   time of course.  ** personal note: I work in IT and found many courses that benefit me in my role.

Why not just put the link under the video title or swipe the current track to display the files (or some other method).  3. Better video player; touch to play/pause  better rewind/forward controls (perhaps gesture control)  auto-subtitles (or transcript)  speed/pitch control.

"Grazillion","This should’ve got 5 stars as it does most of what I need it to do...with one major exception: It doesn’t allow for split-screen when being used on an iPad.  I typically take notes on the right side of the screen with either Evernote or OneNote (depending if I need to write or type)  and I keep whatever I’m learning on the left side of the screen.  That can’t be done with this app. Instead  I have to go to the Udemy website in Chrome  request desktop mode  and use split screen from there.  I have a 12.9” iPad Pro that can easily handle a video being played at a decent size on one side of the screen and a note app on the other side. The screen is not much different from a 13” MacBook Pro screen. But even if I had one of the smaller iPads  I should still be able to view this is split-screen.  To the developers: Please  make it so that the app plays well with Apple’s split screen functionality.

The app WILL show content  and it plays the video almost perfectly. The problem is the buttons for 15-second skipping do not work  and the entire interface is lowered far lower than what I believe was intended. This makes the video player feel dated and unfocused  which hurts the experience a good bit.   I tend to use this app when working on courses  as my desktop screen is used for the applications I’m learning. So far  I love the app and it’s delivery of the service. It just desperately needs an input revamp. Fixing those 15-second skip buttons  raising the input area and adding two finger pinch-controls for full screen mode would warrant a 5 star review from me!

The performance is a little better on my iPhone 7+  but I watch a lot of programming courses and it’s difficult to read the code on a five inch screen.  I prefer using the site on my laptop.  This usage includes perusing the site to find new courses and of course  watching courses.  The company is really shooting itself in the foot since I’m more likely to make an impulse purchase when conveniently checking out new courses with my tablet.

Picture in Picture is unavailable on the iPad. This is a huge inconvenience as most of the other apps out there allow this feature. When you are taking a course  it is crucial to take notes. If you are using an iPad to take a Udemy course it is only natural that you would be taking notes on your iPad with an Apple Pencil. Without the picture in picture feature  this is impossible. Therefore  9.5/10 I am having to use the web version on my computer and take notes on my iPad instead.   2. Downloaded content has a bug where sometimes the content isn’t really downloaded. This is a major pain especially on iPads as most iPad owners do not have cellular access so it can make it very frustrating when you are traveling and you realize your items haven’t downloaded.  I would be very happy to see the Picture in Picture feature resolved! I would change my rating to a 5 even despite the download issue.","-","2","Picture in Picture",2768067158,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id163133513",3.4.11,0

"SolveThisNeedUpdate","- When you go my courses tab and browse one of your purchased courses in mobile app  there is no link to go to the author profile for looking his/her other courses. You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses   a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it.   - When you look for a new course  you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign  you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section  it says after showing some section  “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial  this number depends on the course. Anyway  when you click this link to see whole section  there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section  I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option. This is more user friendly.

Wasn’t sure if I had purchased via the app or via the website so went to Apple first with a request for a refund. The less than obvious hoops you need to go through to submit a request for a refund from Apple would not work for me. The link itself wouldn’t even work once I navigated the many layers of their support onion. I then initiated a chat with Apple and was told by the agent that I couldn’t get a refund. I reminded them that the app developer provides a 30 day refund on courses and still Apple would not give me a refund.  Frustrated  I then emailed Udemy requesting a refund and notifying them that Apple wouldn’t help me. They informed me that they couldn’t refund me because I had purchased through the app rather than online. This was somehow due to Apple’s policy on the matter. However  they were empathetic and even gave me a $5 credit. Also  in an effort to help me with Apple  they removed the courses from my account.  I couldn’t get any further with Apple and then emailed Udemy again letting them know. I also asked if they could just put the courses back on my account since I had purchased them. I figured that I could give them a spin again someday and maybe would have a more positive experience. Udemy responded to me informing me that once they remove a course they can’t put it back in an account. They also informed me that they were crediting me the full amount for he courses! Unexpected and pleasantly surprising!  I wholeheartedly recommend Udemy for virtual learning.

Normalized reviews and pricing -  some awfully high /inflated ratings and prices for rather basic courses with sparse content  or content that is no longer current.   Perhaps a rating score for the raters and some price guides could also help.   2.  Simpler method of categorizing /organizing/labeling  content already purchased to make better buying decisions 3.  Indications of enrolled  wish-listed for courses  on the upper tier of course selection without opening each course and thus more quickly make buying decisions. 4.  Repeating / allowing access to original course  goals / info to enable better course evaluations  find other instructor courses  ... etc. 5.

The speed of loading my data is quite slow  sometimes lags and takes minutes to load my courses; 3. Based on the issue No.1  I downloaded the videos  I thought they would be able to play properly.

"PowerObject!","This used to be on ok app and now it is in the dumps. I’m using iPad Air 2 with the latest iOS 11 and all the apps up to date.  I reported some serious bugs in the last 2 years and NONE of them are fixed so far - not to mention they added NEWER bugs to the app which were also reported to them last year and still  none of them are resolved even though they acknowledged the bugs. This is so FRUSTRATING!!!  It doesn’t download courses in the background and we have to keep the app in the foreground and keep tapping the screen so the device dies not go to sleep and stop downloads.  The downloaded chapters do NOT play offline - even if I turn on the cellular data for this app (as also reported by many users in these reviews and acknowledged by Udemy in these reviews). How difficult is it to play the DOWNLOADED courses sitting on the local device - when a browser can play live online?  If I remove some chapter/section (because it does not play offline) and try to redownload them  it doesn’t even download them - leave alone playing offline. What a pity!  Going into full screen turns the video upside down for no reason.  No way to come out of full screen as they added a white bar on the bottom that covers the controls such as play  pause  full screen  etc and these controls are not visible or accessible (how difficult is it to delete this stupid white bar??).  No progress bar to scroll to a particular position in the video. No way to go to the beginning of the video. I cannot keep pressing 15 seconds back to go to the beginning. Pressing |< goes to the previous video.  No speed  captions or other controls that exist in their we app.  No way to see reviews of purchased courses until logged out. I want to see reviews and ratings in case I purchase multiple courses on the same subject to decide which one to learn first.  No way to mark a course as Favorite for quick access.  No way to sort courses in most recently purchased or most recently accessed  etc order. How hard is it to add another filter option to an EXISTING feature? It is just a tiny where clause filter to SQL and a link in the app to that filter! I have purchased hundreds of courses and it becomes a challenge to wade through every time I need to find a course I purchased because even the newly purchased courses can appear at the end or somewhere in the middle of the list!  Many more bugs to list here (reported all of these and they verified and acknowledged the issues but did not resolve them in 2+years) but these are CRUCIAL issues they chose to IGNORE and not resolve. What they need is a new IT leader and a QA person who understand the seriousness of bugs. Their incapable and dumb programmers - who cannot even think - seem to be capable of keeping their jobs!  Seriously  what’s the point of having an app that can download chapters for offline viewing but does not play them?? Or does not redownload them? I encourage you all users to give this app 1 STAR rating along with a BAD review until they wake up from their slumber  move their butts and resolve these issues as they do not seem to look at their bug log anymore. We’ll revise our review after the issues are resolved. They have 60 thousand courses - why not they learn from those courses how to code  how to fix bugs  how to test or manage an IT project?? This is ridiculous!!! This app is a piece of GARBAGE and BS.  It does not take YEARS to resolve simple issues - it only shows they would take our money but are not interested in fixing the issues. They don’t have programmers to fix the issues - al they do is post canned responses acknowledging the issues. That’s all it is - not a rocket science.

"Ollie C.","Tl;dr: Great courses  bad app (slow  buggy  broken downloads  no split-screen)  There’s some great content on Udemy  but unfortunately  the app is so buggy that it isn’t worth the download at this point.   I’m running the app on a 2017 iPad Pro (iOS 11  not jailbroken) with a decent internet connection to boot  and it is painfully slow. The app takes several minutes to launch  and when it finally does launch  it cannot load any of my content despite the app continually refreshing itself (which is utterly annoying if I leave the app for say 30 seconds to send a text message). I have had this app for all of a day and had to reinstall it twice just to view my courses. The videos are continually buffering  and I have to quit the app several times throughout a 10-minute clip just to finish it! I find that absurd when on this same iPad I'm able to stream two-hour long  HD  HDR videos with no issues while doing something else. As for downloads  they are non-existent. I tried to download a few lectures for my flight yesterday  and despite showing they were offline ready  I couldn't get any of them to load. They still won’t even though I’m online and did a clean install.   Between the constant buffering  broken downloads  lack of split-screen functionality  and general unresponsiveness  the Udemy app is unusable for me. My recommendation is to use the browser version of Udemy and run video PIP if your device is capable of doing so. That won’t solve your offline issues  but you’ll be able to draw along if you’re in an art course like me.","-","2","The App Isn’t Worth Using As Is",2367713121,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id161961100",3.4.6,0

Now I download courses  it shows it is downloaded but doesn’t load. I feel like I have thrown away hundreds of dollars. Very frustrating.   I am now forced to find another platform which allows me to download and use content while commuting.   I tried to raise this issue via your website but to no avail.

Half the videos that indicate they are downloaded will not play  I just get a stupid loading wheel. Now it won’t even play anymore when it’s reconnected to WiFi.  The entire iPad app is trash  is mostly a stretched out phone app  I’d like to be able to view a list of videos in a course without having one of them play whenever I open the course. Separate the media player from the video list.  The entire UI is awkward. The now playing bar thing on the bottom is cumbersome and not suited a a large screen iPad experience. The download feature is awkward to use  some sort of download manager would be nice.  It would also be nice to have picture in picture mode available for videos so that I can take notes with my Apple Pencil in another app.  The udemy content is good  but the app is not.

"Antsy Pantsy 9000","Udemy is great overall. Good content but problematic when it comes to downloading course content offline 😳.  Downloads don’t always complete and are unavailable even when it seems like they may have downloaded. This is a major pain point for travelers who don't have internet access when traveling and just want to take the course. Might be a UX issue though.  Suggestions :   1. Please add a clear download status % indicator for each item. A percentage indicator might work better.  2. Enable true offline access (currently cannot access downloaded udemy without internet access at all).  3. clearly show which downloads are complete and which aren't. Currently the app makes it look like everything is downloaded but once you're without WiFi  the course content is unavailable. A clear download % status would fix this issue. Could change from a red downwards pointing arrow (which is meant to indicate a "downloaded item") to a green tick mark  which makes more sense.  Overall a great service and helpful educational resource.

Or  how is a person supposed to make notes in full-screen without this feature? The lack of this feature needs to be integrated before a competitor sways many yonder.....

"SciArts","Udemy is a great site whose experience and usefulness is degraded by the flaws of its crippled mobile apps. I have it installed on multiple devices on both Android and iOS and the flaws I’ve experienced are essentially identical on both. The app won’t actually download anything for offline use. In Android it switches off SD card use and spins its wheels as it were.   On iOS  it’s even worse. It actually lies to you. It spends however many minutes or hours pretending to download whatever you’ve selected  indicating gradual progress  and eventually completing all while never actually downloading anything at all. I’ve verified this in settings; available storage never decreases.  You can’t add or remove favorites in the app anymore either. This is deeply ANNOYING if you have a sizable library like I do.  Honestly  it feels like some jerk web programmer who doesn’t know Java or Swift sold them on the idea of making a nonnative app with web technologies. This is the kind of dog poop that normally results from those kinds of decisions. But hey  at least we get a poor man’s version of the old logo to go with the new poor man’s code.","-","1","Buggy and Missing Features",2154706276,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27525791",3.4.1,0

The app however deserves a separate mention. Currently it is VERY BAD. I took a few courses on Udemy so this is based on dozens of hours of interacting with the app. It is very glitchy  oftentimes slow or not working at all on an otherwise perfect wifi  not always remembers where you left off  serving podcasts as videos with a static picture etc. etc. One other thing is the subtitles which are automatically generated subs and of very low quality  sometimes to the point if being completely incomprehensible or very misleading. While autogenerated subtitles are ok for  say  youtube  for a platform which strives to be a leader in online education this is unacceptable.

"Sandy Barr","I have done four courses and plan on taking more. I have enjoyed each one. The choices are very diverse. Each instructor has given quick talks on complicated subjects by dividing them into short  easy-to-understand baby steps.  They are fun and entertaining. I found the Italian course very entertaining. I went to Italy for 10 days and felt very comfortable with my limited ability to converse with people.  I had a blast! (Italian people are so gracious and fun loving!  My attempts at words were enjoyed).","+","5","Quick  easy  diverse courses",2079689358,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42769408",3.3.8,1

There was some wonky app behavior around ensuring that each individual section had actually downloaded  babysitting the process  redownloading  etc. And then on the flight it was all useless. Some apparently downloaded lessons would not play  whole sections were unavailable  and there was even a playback glitch where I would click on one lesson to play it and reliably the lesson before it would play instead.","-","3","Great app still needs work",2079388746,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38699081",3.3.8,0

"Rayne2Day","I love this app so far! I’m be only downloaded one lesson so far but it’s really good and I’m learning a lot. I’ve finally able been able to achieve a goal I’ve had for years because of this lesson.  I had thought about taking a course at my local tech center but this is so much better because I can do it at my own home and on my own time.  There are so many lessons and thousands of topics to choose from!  And so far  most of them go on sale for $10.99 at some point which is really nice. Otherwise  I wouldn’t be able to afford them. The only issue I had was purchasing the lesson through the app took about a week for it to finally show up in My Lessons. It is an issue with iTunes I believe but Udemy support kept in contact with me to make sure I was able to access the lesson. Next time  I’ll try purchasing a new lesson on my computer and hopefully will be able to access it on the app more quickly.","+","5","Great app!",2067264238,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id374232752",3.3.8,0
"Sir Damato III","I absolutely love Udemy  but app offline download is useless. It downloads out of sync  and it downloads sporadically. It simply does not act the way you would expect it to. In other words a foundational experience issue.   I was forced to go on holiday with limited access  and less than half a specific course videos I was interested. It would have been fine if the course videos that did download was not so randomly few and far between. It could at least have downloaded in sequence.   When you select to download the course  that’s what you would expect it to do. Yet 24 hours later  only 10 videos of 80 having been downloaded I was forced to cancel  as nothing else is happening. So I tried downloading section by section  and it seems to chuck videos away that was downloaded. I abandoned the exercise.  Only when downloading one by one (yes some people are that desperate)  then it seems to work. Was terribly disappointed to be honest.  Will update review once app is fixed  because Udemy is awesome otherwise!","-","1","Love Udemy  but app offline download is useless.",2065713485,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id162065948",3.3.8,0

I’ll watch a video and wait for the next one to come up and it doesn’t. So I back out and try to hit continue and it shows the video I already completed. My fix for that was to use airplay.
