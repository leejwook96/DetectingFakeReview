I hardly use Facebook anymore because of the same issues that aren‚Äôt being fixed. I‚Äôm an admin for 2 Business Pages and have cut back on Facebook postings.   Update: 10/1/18 Even worse than before! Non stop ads  no posts showing from friends unless it‚Äôs a share from a Facebook page! Hate this app! Please at least being the feeds back where I can set up what to see - not what YOU decide to show me! Read the thousands of bad reviews all saying the same thing and do something about it!   Update: 8/10/18 Facebook is even worse now that you removed friend feeds! I‚Äôm not seeming any posts from my friends unless it‚Äôs something they shared from a Facebook page. I‚Äôm only shown 3 posts and I have close to 200 friends plus pages I like. What do you expect us to do... visit everyone‚Äôs Facebook page to see any posts? Biggest mistake you‚Äôve made. My feeds were the only way I could see posts now Facebook is unusable.   AND... I typed a name of a show I was interested in on my notes app on my iPad. The next day  I see a sponsored video for that show! You are invading our privacy!  Clearly all you care about is money and not the user. You fail to address the thousands of complaints by users.   When I hide a post or any of your unhelpful  unwanted suggestions  they just come back next time I open the app. You still continue to control what I see instead of what I want to see.  I don't see my friend's posts unless they share a page post. I want to see their written posts/photos. I tried setting up multiple feeds but Facebook continues to control what they want me to see-not what I want to see. I've missed so many important posts because Facebook doesn't show me what I want to see. If I choose to receive notifications  I still don't see the posts.  I made a post and it didn't even show in my newsfeed!   Most recent posts does not work at all. I'm shown a post from a week ago.  I don't want to see the non-stop suggested pages  groups  items for sale  friends  etc. No matter how many times I "x" them out  they just keep coming back. If I want to friend  like or follow someone  I'll find it on my own.   I get constant group suggestions and I am forced to provide feedback when I "x" them out.   Same posts and group  friend  page suggestions keep coming back even though I hide them.  Now  suggested friends to add when you visit a group page? Give us a break with the non-stop suggestions!  Today  I had 3 posts on my newsfeed from Facebook for my "February memories" - today is March 10th. Hid them because I don't care. Next few times I've gone on  there they are again!   Seems the only thing that matters to the creator of Facebook is adding to his billions of dollars instead of allowing users to connect what they want.

I like Instagram and I use it everyday. However  the explorer function is both a blessing and a curse. Yes  I found good content based on the pictures/accounts I (myself!!!) liked and/or followed.

I would like to see more content of that what I (myself!!!!!) watch instead of what the people I follow are watching. Does it help that I get naked women in my feed  because someone I-do-not-know liked it 3 days ago? How can Instagram interpret that I would like that on my screen as well? Explorer needs a fix. I want to see the content that ** I ** like  not pictures my friends liked in the past.

The voice message feature does not work for iPhone when sending voice messages to group chats.

You are only able to send a voice messages to group chats when no one else is speaking we‚Äôre looking at Messages for the first time.

This is the 4th time happening to me on this site  as soon as they see you becoming popular they delete you off in efforts of you not reaching the 80k which is when there suppose to give you a cash prize.

I was quite happy that I paid for elite status since I thought I was going to have access to these new features. Especially since most of the people on here are a bunch of horndogs that I'd like to avoid... But it turns out that they took away my elite status and robbed me of my money!!!

All replaced by a clunky group system that doesn‚Äôt even work half the time eating away at time your could be spending enjoying shows or whatever you do with your friends. You can no longer easily navigate the browser without links and sometimes the links don‚Äôt even play the videos! There also is no way to enable subtitles or switch from dubbed to subbed on Netflix or Crunchyroll  unless it is some unknown feature somewhere hidden  which completely ruins watching things with people that only like one or the other. The remote control is broken half the time only able to be fixed by closing the app and restarting.

"Dylan2187_","So on my iPhone  whenever I get sent an invite link  the link takes me to Safari and sends me to the main Rabbit page instead of opening my app and taking me to the room I was invited to join. So to solve this issue  I‚Äôll send a friend request or have someone friend request me  and afterwards they‚Äôll send me an invite through the app  and I‚Äôll join.  But this new update  I‚Äôm not sure how to send friend requests or even accept any friend requests. There is an option to put in a code to join a group  but it didn‚Äôt work when I tried using the link for the group. Cause it seems the code is supposed to be part of the url link  but none of them work. I can still connect with friends I already had  but I‚Äôm not given any option to add any new friends or even receive any friend request in a notification  but I am given the option to send other people invites to sign up for Rabbit.  I‚Äôm not trying to be mean about this response  I only gave one star cause I had to give up on joining a group with my friends. Right now they‚Äôre all watching a movie I wanted to watch with them  they even paused the movie and all tried their best to help me join  but nothing seemed to work. I don‚Äôt have a lap top or computer  so mobile is my only option. All I ask is that there should be an easier option to send and receive friend requests  cause this app seems to have more issues on the iOS.

However  as a mobile user  I have had some pretty major problems that are really frustrating. For one  when hosting or controlling a room on mobile  the controls are bizarre  with where I click and where the cursor shows up being about a literal inch an a half apart (on iPad  at least) making every movement a game of chance where I may exit the program instead of turn up the volume. In addition  the app has a tendency to kick me out of rooms someone else is hosting about once every ~25 minutes  which is more annoying than anything else. However  the chat function and program itself are genuinely very good  and I still use the app frequently.","+","4","A good app with some bad problems",3460978461,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id470065777",2

"Sdhgvjvjvhbn","At rabb.it that is. I love the app/site & hate it at the same time. I‚Äôve really held off way too long to leave a review. This has been a fairly popular site for a few years and on paper it‚Äôs an awesome idea! But why haven‚Äôt the creators figured it out yet...?  Before the site was difficult for me to navigate  and certain things would take forever to load (trust me it‚Äôs not just my connection).  It had big update recently; haven‚Äôt used the app in maybe a month so I‚Äôm not sure exactly what day it updated.  I actually LIKED the mobile update  cause it was a little more simple to navigate & it allowed me to save log ins.  One complaint about the features is that there‚Äôs no cursor option now  which is okay but I think there will be times that I need it. Also rabb.it does have its own time bar but if I try to rewind or skip  or accidentally click the screen  then it restarts the whole episode and I can‚Äôt fix it.  Now onto my main complaints... THE MOBILE UPDATE IS SO BUGGY. Like one day I couldn‚Äôt even view my logins  they refused to load. Another day NONE of the search bars would work; I‚Äôd try to look up a show I searched before & it wouldn‚Äôt even give any me suggestions.  I couldn‚Äôt enter a URL either  even if it was the homepage of a site that I had just copy & pasted from my browser.  Also I don‚Äôt THINK the mobile version is compatible with the desktop version? Because apparently only mobile  not desktop  has ‚Äúgroups‚Äù which is a new feature it seems. When you click ‚Äúwatch now‚Äù on mobiles  it seems automatically makes a group for you/takes you to the last group you were in  not to your room?? Anyways now the show I‚Äôm watching isn‚Äôt loading correctly  it doesn‚Äôt seem to be starting at the right time  and it only has audio while the screen is all black.... I even restarted my phone and logged in & out. Nothing worked.   I hope no one sees this negative review and thinks I‚Äôm just being senseless. I like rabbit and I thank them so much for giving my friends and I this platform  but it‚Äôs annoyed me a helluva lot. I‚Äôm just being honest not only so rabb.it can improve or fix these problems  but also so people don‚Äôt expect so much from the app and end up hating it.","-","1","I‚Äôm mad for the 100th+ time",3422074507,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id369431252",0

"Dylan2187_","So on my iPhone  whenever I get sent an invite link  the link takes me to Safari and sends me to the main Rabbit page instead of opening my app and taking me to the room I was invited to join. So to solve this issue  I‚Äôll send a friend request or have someone friend request me  and afterwards they‚Äôll send me an invite through the app  and I‚Äôll join.  But this new update  I‚Äôm not sure how to send friend requests or even accept any friend requests. There is an option to put in a code to join a group  but it didn‚Äôt work when I tried using the link for the group. Cause it seems the code is supposed to be part of the url link  but none of them work. I can still connect with friends I already had  but I‚Äôm not given any option to add any new friends or even receive any friend request in a notification  but I am given the option to send other people invites to sign up for Rabbit.  I‚Äôm not trying to be mean about this response  I only gave one star cause I had to give up on joining a group with my friends. Right now they‚Äôre all watching a movie I wanted to watch with them  they even paused the movie and all tried their best to help me join  but nothing seemed to work. I don‚Äôt have a lap top or computer  so mobile is my only option. All I ask is that there should be an easier option to send and receive friend requests  cause this app seems to have more issues on the iOS.

"Salty-After-Midnight-sBloom","Rabbit‚Äôs first app interface was a bit buggy at best but still served its purpose quite well. The newest update  however  is basically non-maneuverable. The group option is so confusing and doesn‚Äôt even do 99% of what it should once you scan through it a bit. The new update forces you to watch something through a paid streaming service like Amazon prime and Netflix  browsing for videos on the web yields no results making the app fairly useless. Any of the friends you‚Äôve added prior to the update can‚Äôt be entirely seen making the invite option obsolete. You‚Äôre better off sticking to the desktop option or looking for an app that‚Äôs more competent than whatever cobbled turdnado of an update this is.   My advice?

"Sdhgvjvjvhbn","At rabb.it that is. I love the app/site & hate it at the same time. I‚Äôve really held off way too long to leave a review. This has been a fairly popular site for a few years and on paper it‚Äôs an awesome idea! But why haven‚Äôt the creators figured it out yet...?  Before the site was difficult for me to navigate  and certain things would take forever to load (trust me it‚Äôs not just my connection).  It had big update recently; haven‚Äôt used the app in maybe a month so I‚Äôm not sure exactly what day it updated.  I actually LIKED the mobile update  cause it was a little more simple to navigate & it allowed me to save log ins.  One complaint about the features is that there‚Äôs no cursor option now  which is okay but I think there will be times that I need it. Also rabb.it does have its own time bar but if I try to rewind or skip  or accidentally click the screen  then it restarts the whole episode and I can‚Äôt fix it.  Now onto my main complaints... THE MOBILE UPDATE IS SO BUGGY. Like one day I couldn‚Äôt even view my logins  they refused to load. Another day NONE of the search bars would work; I‚Äôd try to look up a show I searched before & it wouldn‚Äôt even give any me suggestions.  I couldn‚Äôt enter a URL either  even if it was the homepage of a site that I had just copy & pasted from my browser.  Also I don‚Äôt THINK the mobile version is compatible with the desktop version? Because apparently only mobile  not desktop  has ‚Äúgroups‚Äù which is a new feature it seems. When you click ‚Äúwatch now‚Äù on mobiles  it seems automatically makes a group for you/takes you to the last group you were in  not to your room?? Anyways now the show I‚Äôm watching isn‚Äôt loading correctly  it doesn‚Äôt seem to be starting at the right time  and it only has audio while the screen is all black.... I even restarted my phone and logged in & out. Nothing worked.   I hope no one sees this negative review and thinks I‚Äôm just being senseless. I like rabbit and I thank them so much for giving my friends and I this platform  but it‚Äôs annoyed me a helluva lot. I‚Äôm just being honest not only so rabb.it can improve or fix these problems  but also so people don‚Äôt expect so much from the app and end up hating it.","-","1","I‚Äôm mad for the 100th+ time",3422074507,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id369431252",0

"Applfan1","This application is amazing for the dedicated couple who wants their own privacy and personal chat app that‚Äôs not Facebook  Instagram  Twitter  WhatsApp  or Snapchat. But a very couple oriented app that helps you plan dates  keep track of your relationship. Best thing about this app is that it is cross platform between iOS and Android so you don‚Äôt have to have the same operating system as your partner to connect. In addition  the app is smooth and reliable. The only downside is the in app purchases kind of pop up and get in your way sometimes but other than that I think you and your partner will enjoy it.

"srn98s","A lot of the functions - photos  calendar  and a private chat - are really nice and enjoyable to use  but I do have an issue with a bug and also the feasibility of the calendar function.  1. For the call function  every time I hit the call button and start a call  if I have to end the call and call again  I cannot start a call through the call buttons (either in chat or by clicking on their profile) unless I restart the app  which I assume resets the button click function. Not sure how the program works but adding a flag for in call may be helpful. Slight bug but causes a slight inconvenience which gets annoying overtime.  2. Also for the call function  it would be nice if there was a video call and hold function  which seem to be pretty standard across social apps.  3. I like the overall idea of the calendar and I think it's pretty awesome to be able to have my events  my so's events  and shared events  but the fact that you cannot import or sync calendars from either apple or google calendars is really inconvenient. I'm surprised that there's an option to export single events  but again  it would be much easier to export the whole calendar as well. I have all my events and tagged logged in my apple/google calendars (about 30-40 events a week)  which also give me appropriate notifications along with travel times. For me to have to manually input each event once again in the Between calendar is a lot of extra time  so I end up not using the function  even though I really enjoy the idea.  I think if these functions were fixed/added  especially the calendar  I would invest in premium  but at this point  the app acts more like a regular messaging app. Although it separates my conversations with one person with the rest  I can also do that with any other messaging app  but only add one friend on it. Overall  pretty good idea but execution needs to be refined more.","-","3","Good idea  but there are flaws that need to be fixed",3523637742,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272520318",0

"Crlaozwyn","UPDATE 9/14: Still no communication from Between or official fixes  but I did find a way to download an old version. 5.2.2 is the last version that actually works. We‚Äôre able to use the app again  but the lack of support (not to mention the issue in the first place!) is unacceptable. Leaving this at 1* until they actually fix the problem.   UPDATE 8/3: 5.3.3 made it WORSE! Previously my partners phone worked correctly. Now BOTH of our devices are saving all sent pictures to the camera roll.   UPDATE 7/10: 5.3.2 still broken. Support still hasn't responded to me. I guess it's only been a month  so...  UPDATE 7/4/18: version 5.3.1 still has the issue. I've done a factory restore and it hasn't helped. I did get a response from the dev - thanking me for my suggestion to automatically save pics to the camera roll  but letting me know that since this is a privacy focused app  they may not implement my idea. My rage knows no bounds.   UPDATE 6/19/18: New version of the app - yay! Issue still exists - booo! First active developer I've ever encountered who ignores support emails and Facebook/Instagram DMs. I never would have bought Plus if I'd known they cared so little.   UPDATE 6/17/18: Three weeks later  the developer is STILL totally MIA. No "we're aware of the issue." No "Can we get more information?" Nothing. I've sent follow up emails. I've tried messaging them on Facebook (their bot just sends you to the same worthless email). The "Report a Problem" link here goes to the same email too. If you're going to have one email  how about actually checking it occassionally?  Original review: As a long time user and recent Between Plus lifetime subscriber  I'm really sad to be writing a one star review. However  I recently discovered something that's a HUGE issue for a privacy app like this. When my partner sends a picture  it automatically saves a copy to the camera roll. This doesn't happen on my phone  nor is there a setting to disable it (that I've found  anyways). I've written to Between support asking for help  but there has been no response. The potential embarrassment of this issue is huge. Fortunately WE found the issue instead of our kids or a friend.   Until this gets fixed  the app is useless to us. There are plenty of other encrypted messenger apps. If the developer cares enough to either fix the issue or respond to my pleas for help (it's only been two weeks of complete silence)  I'll update this review.","-","1","It used to work...",3188438776,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142015904",0
"Cathgieso","My boyfriend and I have been long distance for a while  and this app has been phenomenal! I can share photos from my camera roll or take them directly so he can keep up with my day-to-day(keep in mind that any photos taken in the app are still stored to your photos). We can also voice call (no video call  sorry!) or chat via the personal message feature. I like the inherent privacy that the app provides... it‚Äôs a special place for just me and my partner!

However one thing that irks me about the app is the lack of "Anniversary" category in the calendar - I have to put it as "Other". We're not married  we don't have kids  and our first kiss was on a different day as our anniversary. It would be nice if this was an option. Plus "first day" doesn't count since we were friends before dating.

I wish that the Apple emojis were bigger like in iMessage and that the gif‚Äôs automatically played like in iMessage instead of having to click on them to open them.  Most importantly  there needs to be more animated Mochi stickers. LOTS MORE! I‚Äôve bought all I could but I still want more of them.

"Crlaozwyn","UPDATE 9/14: Still no communication from Between or official fixes  but I did find a way to download an old version. 5.2.2 is the last version that actually works. We‚Äôre able to use the app again  but the lack of support (not to mention the issue in the first place!) is unacceptable. Leaving this at 1* until they actually fix the problem.   UPDATE 8/3: 5.3.3 made it WORSE! Previously my partners phone worked correctly. Now BOTH of our devices are saving all sent pictures to the camera roll.   UPDATE 7/10: 5.3.2 still broken. Support still hasn't responded to me. I guess it's only been a month  so...  UPDATE 7/4/18: version 5.3.1 still has the issue. I've done a factory restore and it hasn't helped. I did get a response from the dev - thanking me for my suggestion to automatically save pics to the camera roll  but letting me know that since this is a privacy focused app  they may not implement my idea. My rage knows no bounds.   UPDATE 6/19/18: New version of the app - yay! Issue still exists - booo! First active developer I've ever encountered who ignores support emails and Facebook/Instagram DMs. I never would have bought Plus if I'd known they cared so little.   UPDATE 6/17/18: Three weeks later  the developer is STILL totally MIA. No "we're aware of the issue." No "Can we get more information?" Nothing. I've sent follow up emails. I've tried messaging them on Facebook (their bot just sends you to the same worthless email). The "Report a Problem" link here goes to the same email too. If you're going to have one email  how about actually checking it occassionally?  Original review: As a long time user and recent Between Plus lifetime subscriber  I'm really sad to be writing a one star review. However  I recently discovered something that's a HUGE issue for a privacy app like this. When my partner sends a picture  it automatically saves a copy to the camera roll. This doesn't happen on my phone  nor is there a setting to disable it (that I've found  anyways). I've written to Between support asking for help  but there has been no response. The potential embarrassment of this issue is huge. Fortunately WE found the issue instead of our kids or a friend.   Until this gets fixed  the app is useless to us. There are plenty of other encrypted messenger apps. If the developer cares enough to either fix the issue or respond to my pleas for help (it's only been two weeks of complete silence)  I'll update this review.","-","1","It used to work...",3188438776,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142015904",0

We can also voice call (no video call  sorry!) or chat via the personal message feature. I like the inherent privacy that the app provides... it‚Äôs a special place for just me and my partner!

However  I was very disappointed to open the app after many months of being away from it to find that I must have something against my account. I'm currently a paying member  no access to new members  no access to featured members. Little to no results because I'm not showing up on anyone's radar. This is a fun app when you want someone to talk to and no one is around to text. I've met some great people. I have no idea why my account could be flagged other than the fact that I don't always reply or I have declined a nude photo.

However  I was very disappointed to open the app after many months of being away from it to find that I must have something against my account. I'm currently a paying member  no access to new members  no access to featured members. Little to no results because I'm not showing up on anyone's radar. This is a fun app when you want someone to talk to and no one is around to text. I've met some great people. I have no idea why my account could be flagged other than the fact that I don't always reply or I have declined a nude photo. I have even spent 2 000 points with the virtual plane tickets to meet more people on here but given my accounts current state that didn't work either.

A few weeks after downloading the app  a nice guy sent me a message. I got the urge to block him a few times simply because I didn't see the point in talking to him! ( I was sceptical of the men on the app since most wanted to cyber) He was consistently sweet and respectful toward me.  Thank God I didn't block him because he is now my boyfriend and we have been happily together for 4 months and I recently went to meet his parents! It makes me feel sick that I almost blocked him because he is truly the love of my life!   Give this app a chance! There are many crazy strange people on it but you may find a great friend and/or more! I guess he and I got extremely lucky!","+","5","Great App!

While it does have its perks to having for a player I do believe some fixes could be made. For the longest time after getting the app myself and a friend couldn‚Äôt get the emblem creator to properly save the emblems that we had created  after about three weeks of having the app I discovered that I was suddenly able to save the emblem but even after saving the emblem it looked like I hadn‚Äôt made the emblem at all in the screen following tapping on the icon to save the emblem.

Sure their may be some bad reviews on this app  but some updates for the other champs could make the "community" a little better too! Also another thing  a recommended thing to say from a community fellow like me... You should add some background music from the battlefield games depending on which tab your on  on this app  I understand that this app can be really helpful (REALLY = in bold) but some music to keep the people using it feel like battlefield will never leave their side and yes of course  your side and my side as well (in a friendly way)!

It will tell you to log in your EA account even if you have logged in your EA account. Basically meaning any users who don't play battlefield 1 can't even view there stats for battlefield 4  also they do not support battlefield hardline so there's that as well. I've personally spent hours searching for some way to fix this bug and there is none. Other than that problem the app is great and I would rate it five stars.","-","3","Great interface but has some bugs that need fixing",1570207324,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id558013950",2

"TheHendricksoExp","So  I bought the Early Enlister edition of Battlefield 1  and I thought to myself  "There's a companion app? I might as well get that too". The night  I wasn't able to sleep  partly because of playing BF1 until 3 am but also reasons. I decided to scroll through the app. I was very pleased to see that it displays most  if not all  stats  allows you to customize loadouts(for the 4 base classes  not the vehicle classes for some reason)  and it allows you to distinguish what each variant of weapon does. I enjoy the app. It does what it does well enough. However it can make improvements here and there. For example  maybe a battlepack system to open battlepacks and view skins. Or a way to observe the 3D models of the vehicles and their skins. Allow customization of the tanker and pilot classes. But  the biggest issue I have with it so far  is the information it displays is out of sync. Like  I'm easily at rank 2 with all classes  but the app displays my class progress to be between rank 1 and 2. It's pretty bothersome to say the least. However  other than those few critiques  I think this does it's job well enough to receive 3 stars.   P.S. For those complaining about other Battlefield game to not be supported on this app  get a cheapo laptop and use that for Battlelog with the other games. It works just as well  if not better.","-","3","Could Use a Few Improvements",1472401632,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id255470631",0

"ApacheAH-64A","Compared to the Battlelog App used for Battlefield 3  Battlefield 4  & Battlefield Hardline; this streamlined version is a small step backwards from what it used to be.   The majority of features available from the Battlelog system or no longer in this app. Instead  you get a bunch of news feeds and videos for you to read and watch which feels like a social media platform and in my opinion feels completely pointless.   On top of that  you can no longer save your best battles that you played. Also  Battlefield 3 statistics are not even counted toward your "Career"  a major step in the wrong direction! (Battlefield Hardline is not counted as well  but they say that will come in a latter update).  However  the new streamlined look makes tracking your stats much easier then in previous versions  but why EA & DICE don't put these in the game itself will always make no sense to me. The creation of custom emblems on a mobile device instead of going to a PC is a nice feature to have now  and doing changing your loadout on the go is fast and simple.   Overall  the new look performs well  but removing features that people liked while adding new ones is not the way to go. Don't take away  leave it alone and add more!   3/5 (Would rate 2.5/5 if possible).","-","3","What Happened To Battlelog & BF3 Stats?",1471952125,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id181784784",0
