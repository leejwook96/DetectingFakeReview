Does a fantastic job of reinforcing words  syntax  masculine versus feminine use  and appears to taylor itself to your shortcomings and strengths.  You start out learning like a kid and then it teaches you the correct usage when you’re dying to know anyway. This is beautiful and well thought out.  If you’re an adult I recommend it. You will never learn a language as naturally  quickly or as easily. If you give this to kids  parents will be shocked when their kids start talking to them in a different language in a matter of weeks.

With the latest release they’ve cleaned up the interface in general and  in particular  they’ve finally fixed that annoying bug. Yea!

One suggestion to the creators is to add some sort of an archive of the words I’ve learned that way I can review the word and it’s translated meaning. I’ll be sitting somewhere and a Spanish word will come to me like a song stuck in my head and I can’t for the life of me remember what it means.

"Me223312","When I began learning Dutch vocabulary with Duolingo  I never remembered it and it was never useful. They don’t explain why your answer is wrong even when it’s grammatically correct  all Duolingo is is random phrases that make no sense whatsoever with Google Translate sentences. You could simply type in “The bear eats boots” on GT and still get the same grammatical and weird phrase on Duolingo. Trash! I switched to Babbel a few months back  their grammar is explained in an easy to understand way for a 12 year old  (aka me) and their voice recognition is strict  thats a good thing because you cannot sneeze into the mic and get a green “Correct” like on Duolingo. Instead  you actually have to train your pronunciation correctly numerous times  which Babbel clearly does. And Babbel also has spaced repition flashcards  writing and speaking exercises which may be why I remember the phrases and vocabulary so well. They teach verb tenses and conjugations  acronyms and cultural stuff. Great job Duolingo  you made a trashy app! I guarentee all these Duolingo users THINK they are learning a language  but they can’t remember simple vocabulary like us Babbel users. Anyways  don’t use Duolingo  all you’ll learn is “A bear pees in a boot” or “The worm hugs the dinosaur”.","-","2","Uh no",3525720072,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id365862926",1

I’m writing all my lessons and vocabulary on a small notebook  and the tips and notes section helps me a lot with my grammar. Writing that section on that notebook has helped me tons  but I can’t access it from my phone!

Work to your level 5’s and it’s hard to believe you’ll be typing  reading and listening in Russian (or something else) in no time. My only qualm with this app is the lack of problem solving with responses. So far it’s just translating in different degrees (listen  read  speak)  but  it would be much more engaging if asked a question in the target language and had to give the correct response. A lot like a back and forth dialogue would really help substantially with harnessing a reactionary response  whilst using the new grammar patterns and vocabulary. Good morning  how are you? I’m good  and you? Not so great  I’m looking for my dog  etc.  That’s my honest opinion.","+","4","Problem solving.",3521261590,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id937508219",0

I can’t even say much about the content of Duolingo because the ads show up every three minutes or so and distract from the lessons. What’s the point of saying it’s a free service when you’re bombarded with ads or prompts to upgrade. I think I’m resisting the existing premium subscription on principle at this point.

You have to get those hearts by either practicing your worst skills  which doesn’t really help me learn; submitting to a paywall  and it’s kinda dumb that you have to pay to get smart on a mobile device; or waiting literally three hours for a single heart. You could run out of hearts in the night  go to bed  and only gain about three hearts if you sleep in a lot. If the heart time limit was around one hour long instead of three  I wouldn’t have chucked my iPad into a lake and had to write the review on my phone. Plus  don’t try to chuck an iPad into a lake.

"Jackryan15","Duolingo is really fun for me. I like to study languages in a game-like environment rather than studying. There are some problems  though. On the app  with the new update  you cannot skip to level 2  3  4  or 5. You can only skip to the first level. If I go onto the website so I can skip to a level  it glitches and freezes until I force quit Safari. Also  the Duolingo website has more content than the app. The website allows you to delete languages or restart them. It also lets you skip to different levels as mentioned above. Also  when you select a new course  you get a full description of your language and the names of the contributors. The app doesn’t have this; however  the user interface is more pleasing on the app  and the app is less glitchy. When I use it  I alternate between the website and the app. This does help me learn languages  though. Overall? I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language for free.

I don’t think I missed a day but when I got home  I found that my streak had been taken away. I was disappointed but I got over it. Now  though  I can’t figure out how to keep a streak going! I know for a fact that I have done my Spanish every day but my streak keeps getting taken away. The only thing that I can figure out is that Duolingo is going by a different time zone than I am in. Case in point  I just lost a 19-day streak. When it showed which days i had missed  it said that I had missed Thursday and Friday of this week. I know for a fact that I did it on Thursday! As for Friday  I did my Spanish at around 11:45 pm (MST) and it did not count! I know it’s not that big of a deal  it’s just frustrating!

"MissMisfit92","I have learned more from using this app than I did when I was taking Spanish 1 and 2 in college! I would definitely recommend!  There are only two problems I have with using this app. One is that there aren’t as many speaking opportunities (like in Rosetta Stone) so you get more used to relying on reading the Spanish than actually hearing and replying. The second problem is that when I do those practice “tests” to strengthen my knowledge and understanding  it doesn’t count towards the individual skills. This means I have to spend extra time in skills I already have a good grasp on  which is tedious and  therefore  boring. If I already have a decent understanding of a skill  I don’t want to do 20 extra lessons on that skill to complete it to level 5. It would be great if we could continue to test out of skills. For right now  we can only test out of one of the levels of that skill.","+","4","¡Muy divertidos!",3486806433,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id188673453",0

Since the update in April  I haven’t gone on as much because I find it very annoying to have to stop learning because  I made some mistakes in typing and lost all my strength. I also don’t like that each level has so many rounds you have to complete and each round has the same sentences with a few different conjugations. Every time I go on now I spend maybe five minutes because I make errors and run out of strength....I didn’t want to play a game  I wanted to LEARN and I don’t find it very easy to do that anymore.

But then there have been so many changes that it’s affecting the functionality of the app. Each lesson used to open up automatically  and now  it takes 2 minutes or more to load each lesson or the app closes out so I’ve given up in frustration. This has been going on for a few months now and it’s still not fixed. What use is this app if it’s so buggy you can’t even open a lesson? Also  I don’t understand why you removed the language bots in Spanish. I LOVED that part of it. It helped me quite a bit being able to converse with a bot and knowing if I was using the language correctly. You still have language bots for other languages. Please bring it back.

"Pinkrose1422","This app helps with learning (Japanese for me) and it’s lovely. It goes over match making the Japanese alphabet (Hiragana and Katakana)  translating basic sentences or vocabulary  and has hearing practice also.   But it doesn’t tell you what you’re going to be learning. It just throws you in. There is no explanation  it doesn’t show you a chart of Hiragana or Katakana  it just throws you right into it without preparation. I know Hiragana and Katakana so I got them right  but it’s the fact it doesn’t give you any form of preparation. (I choose “Beginner” so it is fully new and I also choose the option for a placement test to see where I fit in with) and both didn’t give preparation on what you’re going into.   I wish it’ll give you lessons or at least tell you what you’re going to be learning. A simple review for it quizzing you. Other than it not preparing you and you just having to go bare into it and hold you know /something/ it’s pretty good.","-","3","Good but not fully",3476981791,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id278668319",0

"Jason D 2018","Being able to study a language at your leisure and on your time frame is a marvelous experience. I am studying French after taking 25 years off and studying Spanish at which I am already very proficient (really just to ensure that the French does not “overwrite” my Spanish). I have made a good amount of progress in French and have enjoyed it. I have found Spanish a bit more frustrating. Part of it is my fault because I try to fly through. Part of it though is the program’s low tolerance for ambiguity. It commonly views a word as having one translation and does not accept other answers  but the answer that it accepts changes.   For example  “Mi novia no conoce a mucha gente”. I would translate as my fiancé (or girlfriend) does not know (or does not meet) many (or a lot) of people. Which one of the original words would be correct or incorrect?  All of them. It doesn’t matter. When I choose one of the possible translations  the other one is almost always correct. Given that there are many combinations and which one the program chose would change  it was almost impossible to guess correctly. I chose “many”  but the program chose “a lot”. The next time I would choose “a lot ” but the program chose “many!”  My “health” dwindled to nothing and I was forced to stop. My son had a similar experience with French. I  however  don’t know enough in French to see the ambiguities in translations.   I thought about giving it 3 stars from this  but the good is so amazing that it outweighs the frustrating bad.","+","4","It’s great but…",3475993441,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30735920",0

"So many meds!","Duolingo does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. My review is strictly for Japanese as an English speaker. I have not tried the other languages.  Pros: * It has short lessons (at first) which are good for those with a busy lifestyle  and usually focusing on one concept. * Good enough of a focus on vocabulary. Lots of random words  although not too many synonyms.  Cons: * There's barely any emphasis on kanji. You simply cannot learn to read actual Japanese with Duolingo  and worse  when you try to type in kanji you happen to already know it will often mark you as incorrect! This is unacceptable. * Although it started with shorter lessons  towards the end it feels as though the lesson planners started packing in more and more concepts into each individual lesson. This makes trying to finish your daily lessons a chore and you can end up in a rolling failure where you lose all your health trying to remember that other concept you know you /just/ went over 5 questions ago. Too bad  so sad; better pay up for a health refill or you get to start all over with a practice session covering other random concepts! * There's very few lessons and after about 3/4ths of the way through they haven't covered anything but formal textbook-style speaking. Good luck talking to actual Japanese people! * After looking through the screenshots I'm surprised to see other languages have speaking lessons. There are no speaking lessons where you are corrected for pronunciation for Japanese.  Other: * It often feels like the grading is strict simply to dock you of health. Come on  typos are typos and you should be able to handle them. * I wish I could turn off the encouragements. With it always congratulating you after 5 or 10 correct answers in a row it's too regular and easy to attain  so it comes off as robotic and forced. Maybe congratulate me for hitting 100 correct answers in a row instead of 10? Or completing a lesson without any mistakes?","-","3","Review of Japanese",3468234877,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id424483497",0

"Saraazzam97","Spanish is needed just as much as English in my area so of course an app on my phone that could teach me Spanish was a must have. I’ve tried a couple others and this one is definitely one of the easiest to use and teaches functional language. I love the conversation lesson  making you use what it just taught you in a conversation. Definitely makes me remember what I’ve learned much more than just matching words to pictures.   My one and only complaint is it doesn’t have Arabic. I’m learning Spanish out of necessity but I’m dedicating study time into Arabic and I know if I could learn it on here  it would be amazing!","+","5","Easy and Functional",3461668203,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id484260744",0

My high school lessons have come back to me after 45 years  and I’m much stronger with it now than I was then. It’s great for challenging my brain!    The biggest issue I’m having at the moment is that I’ve reached a point where I’m getting pretty good with more complex sentences and happy to push forward on that  but it feels as though the developers aren’t offering much now. I’m getting a lot of sentences that translate to “I am a spider” and “Bears eat crabs.” It seems like a lost opportunity to teach additional vocabulary  and are tiresome to translate and type out. I hope to get through these quickly and start to make progress again. I’m really hoping there are further challenges ahead. I’ve come so far and enjoyed it so much.

I am still a beginner but it is not as hard as I thought it would be! This app is very helpful but  I really don’t like how you have health and when you get something wrong you lose one piece of your health and you can run out. You either have to use 400 gems to continue or buy health to practice more. I think that when a person is first starting another language  they should have more health bars and as they go on the amount of full heath bars you can have will decrease.

First  in the clubs  people should not be able to get points on the leaderboard by testing out of levels. Taking those shortcuts puts people who can’t take them at a disadvantage. The rankings should be based solely on how many individual exercises are completed.   Second  I currently have 200 lingots and absolutely nothing to spend them on. How hard would it be to make a few more clothing options  or different background skins and color schemes to spend them on?  Or an experience multiplier?   Also  why is there no dictionary included in the app? Why is the tiny cards flash card app separate instead of included in this and part of the XP options? It would be way better if I could practice a duolingo exercise then switch over to a dictionary then flash cards all in the same app.   Lastly  there should be an option to turn off the requirement to type and just use multiple choice. The constant typing is tiring and often not necessary for many of the exercises that have more obvious answers.

Overall  this app is pretty good  but here’s some things I really don’t like.  -Ads after every lesson  Okay  I get it  this is a free service  but every single lesson plus Duolingo’s own ads for Duolingo Plus  which removes these ads.  -Inexplicable loss of streak  Yeah  your streak is just a number  but that number meant something to me. I lost a 246 day streak just today for no reason I can figure out. It’s not after midnight  I had a streak freezer  etc.  so I don’t know how or why I lost it  and this is the second time this has happened (I’d still like an explanation for this one  and I’m not paying $14 to restore it).

"Celine0446","Get the app. I promise it'll be great. An interesting and convenient way to learn a new language. The fun  life simulating conversations and effective practice lessons reinforce good vocab and language skills. The interface is also clean and not cluttered. The listening and speaking practices are very helpful. Overall  a very thorough and practical approach to cover all aspects of a new language. The chat rooms provide an another great outlet to practice conversations with fellow language learners or respond to automated prompts. And it's free!!!!  The one drawback I see is that it can get a bit repetitive for fast learners. After the initial placement test  it's not readily available to test out of certain skills if you already know material  maybe from earlier studies. Other than that  Duolingo is the ideal app for those who want to learn another language. Couldn't ask for anything better  So far  they offer Spanish  French  German  Chinese  Hawaiian  Navajo  Japanese  Korean  Italian  Portuguese  Dutch  Irish  Danish  Swedish  Turkish  Esperanto  Norwegian  Ukrainian  Russian  Polish  Welsh  Hebrew  Vietnamese  Hungarian  Greek  Swahili  Romanian  Czech  Hindi  Indonesian  Klingon  and High Valyrian","+","5","Pretty much perfect",3433830282,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id821257428",0

Duolingo was update last night and as I have suspected for a while now  the app itself is sometimes the cause of a streak loss. When I opened the app to complete my lesson for the day I immediately noticed that the app had been updated and I HAD LOST MY STREAK. Now I’m mad at the app instead of myself because I know I had done my lesson the previous day and it’s frustrating. It is also frustrating to be traveling and not have WiFi and/or cell service and lose a streak because you didn’t know to freeze it ahead of time. BEWARE! The only way to fix a lost streak at this point is to give them money. Not going to happen from this user when it’s not my  fault.

"@RiqoTiqo","I always joke about learning nothing in my 4 years of French. But this app infuriated me. First off  I told it I was basically experienced and it started by asking me the most basic and obvious questions (ex: chat et garçon) and even when I’m consistently getting it right  it doesn’t get harder AT ALL. I know I cheated most of the 4 years & had 5 different teachers  but I learned a bit to know stuff. AND THEN right before deciding I need to get another app  I log back in and continue my third module. One of the first questions is “Bonjour” and the correct is Morning and there’s not even an option for Hello/Goodbye. I literally almost lost my mess and I’m about to delete this app and I discourage anyone actually trying to learn using this. Sorry if I offended anyone but ugh this app is trash.

"So many meds!","Duolingo does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. My review is strictly for Japanese as an English speaker. I have not tried the other languages.  Pros: * It has short lessons (at first) which are good for those with a busy lifestyle  and usually focusing on one concept. * Good enough of a focus on vocabulary. Lots of random words  although not too many synonyms.  Cons: * There's barely any emphasis on kanji. You simply cannot learn to read actual Japanese with Duolingo  and worse  when you try to type in kanji you happen to already know it will often mark you as incorrect! This is unacceptable. * Although it started with shorter lessons  towards the end it feels as though the lesson planners started packing in more and more concepts into each individual lesson. This makes trying to finish your daily lessons a chore and you can end up in a rolling failure where you lose all your health trying to remember that other concept you know you /just/ went over 5 questions ago. Too bad  so sad; better pay up for a health refill or you get to start all over with a practice session covering other random concepts! * There's very few lessons and after about 3/4ths of the way through they haven't covered anything but formal textbook-style speaking. Good luck talking to actual Japanese people! * After looking through the screenshots I'm surprised to see other languages have speaking lessons. There are no speaking lessons where you are corrected for pronunciation for Japanese.  Other: * It often feels like the grading is strict simply to dock you of health. Come on  typos are typos and you should be able to handle them. * I wish I could turn off the encouragements. With it always congratulating you after 5 or 10 correct answers in a row it's too regular and easy to attain  so it comes off as robotic and forced.

"Bee U Nique","I downloaded the app 59 days ago  and have been using it for three lessons every day since to learn Spanish. Today  when I got into the app to continue my streak  all progress had been lost. It has an interesting game-like structure that allows you to earn achievements  level up skills  etc.  but losing all of your progress is not acceptable for any application. Further  I know that having to spell and develop sentence structure may not be as fast  fun or easy as matching games or constructing sentences using multiple choice options (which seem to comprise the majority of questions) but I know that it helps with understanding grammar and vocabulary retention. Picking from the boxes below does not prepare you for real life scenarios.

"Clovis the Hoofed","I’ve used duolingo for quite awhile and have watched as they rolled out new features. The current gamification for someone brushing up is an incredible disincentive to practicing. When my phone autocorrects words as I hit enter and I accidentally bump the wrong key on the train I’m basically left having to wait hours for accidents instead of practicing.  Waiting 4 hours to continue learning when I have 30 minute commute is terrible. I’m not saying they shouldn’t get paid but the balance is completely off on the gem for health feature. Earning 13 gems for hitting my target for the day  when paying 350 to refill my health at means I have to play for a month before I can refill my health gauge once and that assumes I even get 12 or 13 since the number of gems is random.","-","1","New features are awful",3462892999,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id137211887",1

"LaLaKyla","Just taking the placement test for Japanese  I’m seeing QUITE a few issues.  The pronunciation of the Kanji is wrong  for starters. 日曜日 (にちようび or nichiyoubi) was pronounced “ひようび or hiyouhi”. If I didn’t already know this  then I would have thought Sunday was pronounced COMPLETELY wrong.  Additionally  major  MAJOR pillars in Japanese are skipped in sentences. The major pillars I am referring to are PARTICLES. imagine staying in English “Kyla’s chair that she is sitting on is blue” as “Kyla chair she is siting is blue”.  Don’t worry  there’s more. Whole words are wrong and it isn’t possible to have multiple answers when sentence structure is ambiguous.  Least importantly  because at this point I’m just being picky  I don’t see why their programming isn’t to the point that it can sound like a Japanese person is speaking  when sentences are being said. Why does it sound like google translate? That’s just simple programming laziness.","-","1","How is it possible for one app to be so wrong  so consistently?",3459405360,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id932748444",0

"TheOneAndOnly_3","First of all this app is amazing! So what I did was an experiment with the app. Well for starters I am a Sophomore in High-school  and I have been using the app since 8th grade. So  for the experiment  every other test I used the app and the others I didn’t. I noticed that when I used my normal notes I did ok on the test  but I knew I could surely do better. On tests I did not use the app to study for  I would make around a high “C” or low “B”. While when I studied using the app I would make a high “B” to an “A”. I know that some of you are thinking why would a 10th grader take this risk for their grade in classes  but at my school you can retake every test you take once. You can only retake if you have lower than a 89% and that is the highest “B” possible. So it wasn’t a big risk because the day I would get my grades back  the same night I would go home a study again but using Quiz-let. And I would more than likely get an “A”. So I really recommend this app. Every since I started using the app  I became an all “A” student and that occasional one “B”.","+","5","Amazing Great for Studying!!!",3538275995,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id838429486",0
"Rachel.Luvs.Cookies","Okay  so I’ve been using Quizlet for quite a while and it’s been helping me a lot. I always found it hard to study a paper when the answers were literally right on it. I also have the worst memory  so Quizlet’s “Learn” option repeats the questions and it helps me tremendously. Though  there are some... problems that should be fixed.   1. First of all the studying options are limited on the phone  mainly because I can’t create diagrams using a phone  so I have to get on a laptop which takes more time that I don’t have.  2. Though I am paying for Quizlet Plus  I do agree with everyone else that you should at least make the night theme free. Some people have a hard time reading words in a bright background  especially at night. I wear glasses and can read words with a bright background  but it’s really not healthy for the eyes.  3. When I’m studying I come across typos and I find it quite annoying when I have to go to the editing mode. It’d be easier if you could access the editing mode right there so it’ll be quick.   — Recommendations 🍡 I think that  when you guys get the chance  you should add more modes to learn though. Honestly? You could turn Quizlet into an optional game that has currencies  shops  etc! I think that would definitely motivate people to study more! Not only that  but it helps the forests! Instead of using paper  you can use Quizlet!","+","4","Amazing studying app  but...",3528403113,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id511209116",0

Since I’m not fan of flash cards because I am not sure how effective or efficient they are to use as various way to study for quiz  exam or standardized tests.   I’ve been making flash card sets for few weeks  and I feel surprisingly pleased and impressed with Quizlet. Please keep on running Quizlet forever and ever. These are great studying tool for students who are self studying or studying for any particular subject  major  quiz or standardized test.   Also  I am unsure how using Quizlet as study tool will impact on my grades though. There are other things I have to work on other than just studying. Like getting good night rest because I’m like Dracula so I may have adjust my sleep habits  reduce screen time and rest and relax. I do have a good feeling my grade will boost if I just continue quizzing myself continuously using Quizlet when I’m on the bus  at home or anywhere.   Quizlet is perfection! Oh by the way I notice your subscription is absolutely affordable  since I’m unemployed college student in community college with a disability. I do not have the money but I love to some day try an affordable subscription just to not necessarily study vocabulary words. Yet create my own practice tests so I can put myself to the test.

"smartkid101","I love this app but sometimes it can be VERY annoying. There are too many adds which cover the content and distract you from trying to study. Also  the voice recognition  (where you speak into your phone’s microphone and you speak in the definition of a vocabulary word) does not work at all. For example  I will speak a simple word  and it pops up on my phone screen not at all what I said. I am trying to do some quick vocabulary words  and that just ticks me off when you are pressed for time. I don’t know about other people  but I am an EXTREMELY busy person  and it doesn’t help at all when an app like this won’t function correctly. Please fix this horrible error IMMEDIATELY!

Here are some quick suggestions to consider:  -combining sets was so helpful  I’m not sure if the option is still available on the computer but it isn’t on my phone... needs to come back!  -the “supscription” is something I wish didn’t exist — I know you want to make money but for some of us that don’t want to pay the free version makes us not like the app...  -color!! Blue gets so boring after a while — color  highlighter etc. would totally make your app get higher ratings!  -I think a cool addition would be something like where we can take a picture of an essay/document and “highlight” on our phones and write little “post it’s” that when you click on it  it expands and shows your writing.  -being able to change our username more than once...  Anyways I do love this app but those are just things I thought of you may want to consider :)  Have a great day!","+","4","Great...but could use some suggestions!",3372416683,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id681876543",0
"VictoriaSilvis","I have low grade in Psychology currently. Since I’m not fan of flash cards because I am not sure how effective or efficient they are to use as various way to study for quiz  exam or standardized tests.   I’ve been making flash card sets for few weeks  and I feel surprisingly pleased and impressed with Quizlet. Please keep on running Quizlet forever and ever. These are great studying tool for students who are self studying or studying for any particular subject  major  quiz or standardized test.   Also  I am unsure how using Quizlet as study tool will impact on my grades though. There are other things I have to work on other than just studying. Like getting good night rest because I’m like Dracula so I may have adjust my sleep habits  reduce screen time and rest and relax. I do have a good feeling my grade will boost if I just continue quizzing myself continuously using Quizlet when I’m on the bus  at home or anywhere.   Quizlet is perfection! Oh by the way I notice your subscription is absolutely affordable  since I’m unemployed college student in community college with a disability. I do not have the money but I love to some day try an affordable subscription just to not necessarily study vocabulary words. Yet create my own practice tests so I can put myself to the test. I don’t like being tested because I have watched and read enough videos and articles regarding measures on students success and performance.

I just downloaded the app and went to look at Spanish flash cards.   I checked out three sets and immediately found spelling and grammar errors in each set. Some of the spelling errors might have been typos  but not all of them. The errors were in both English and Spanish.

I absolutely LOVE the fact that the app can form a practice test out of the terms and definitions that you fill out  it is SO helpful! The only thing that I kind-of find annoying is how  when I’m taking a practice test  I will answer the question correctly but I might leave something lowercase or uppercase and it says that I got the answer wrong. I don’t know if it does that to anyone else  but it does to me and it’s a bit annoying.

"Jay Trades","First off  I love Quizlet. But there are some aspects that are lacking that could easily be implemented into the program.   1. Folders need to be able to have sub-folders. This will make things less messy and more organized for the user.   2. Manual sorting of sets in both folders and classes. Again  we need to keep things orderly (for those who want it). It’s about ease of access to find what you want when you want it.   3. The option to add a “card” being 1 term with its definition to your own set — so that you don’t have to a) re-type everything and b) don’t copy the set   These things  especially points 1 & 2 should be fairly easy for the developers to implement. Since we the user lack these abilities that’s why i see this as a 3 Star program. Add them  and you got an easy 5 Star. Organization of ones thoughts is key.

"**Honest Beauty**","I have been a Quizlet Plus subscriber for years and I like the overall concept of Quizlet. But  I found myself wasting away HOURS of time trying to compensate for poor development of the app. Many nights I would feel defeated after realizing how much time I wasted creating flashcards to be functional for my purpose.   If you are not creating flashcards  then my gripes won't pertain to you. I am a visual learner and I also thrive on order/organization. One of my BIGGEST issues with Quizlet is the formatting! I have literally thrown my papers in the air out of frustration lol They seriously need to work on the way the system autoformats the text. It centers things based on the number of characters and this is sooooo annoying! There needs to be an option to leave formatting starting from the Left  regardless of character count; because  things dont look right centered on many cards and everyone learns differently. It completely throws off the purpose of a card to highlight key things quickly. Please fix this issue! Please! Another issue is the Bold option for words. They seriously need to come up with a better way to Bold words instead of having to type * before and after the word/phrase to bold! Its time consuming and wasteful. A Bold button would be a nice feature to add to the web version for starters. Also  bolding terms gets more irritating due to the issue with formatting everything to the Center! Once you Bold a word w/in a sentence etc. Since the system wants to center everything  you are likely to have text wrapping around to a 2nd sentence because of the size adjustment with Capitalizing and Bolding. Additionally  the Bold feature isn't really Bold! Lol its not bright enough to really stand out. I find myself having to Capitalize and Bold a word for it to stand out!   Another formatting gripe is the lack of option to indent or create bullets  numbered values. Again  since everything wants to be Centered  it throws off any kind of list  unless you create something long and at that point the system reverts back to formatting the flashcard from the Left! Its irritating. Another formatting issue lol is the "Math/Symbols" language option. I love having this as an additional keyboard/language for creating cards  but the way it takes over so much of the screen with it's drop down window is annoying.   The study modes need severe work. If you create folders  you can study a different way (which I prefer the way where you hit Know or Don't Know)  but that progress is separate from the "Learn" option within a particular set! Its so crazy. So now I have to create folders with ONE set inside of them  in order to get both study options ( the Know/Don't Know version vs. Learn). Additionally when studying  the system automatically puts your cards on "definition" first. Its annoying to have to change this for every set! Why not have a preference button that applies to our user profile and/or per each set/folder and that way we don't have to constantly adjust settings to have the "term" side show first! Notable mentions of other irritating features: 1) the search feature ( I thought search meant search your OWN terms or sets to find duplicate cards)  but nope! It will search the galaxy and beyond lol 2) Editing sets should be easier 3) image uploads are great  but possibly being able to crop or edit the image better would be nice  also adding images to the term side would be highly delightful.   A huge "no no" for me is the numerous times I have been creating cards on the actual site (vs importing a document) and this new auto search feature they added kicks in 🙄! Annoying! If I type in a word  it will search Quizlet and pull up suggestions already on Quizlet or the internet...the issue with this is  sometimes when typing  when you hit "return" to skip to a new line  it will erase your content and insert whatever quizlet  search found. I despise it! Turn it off or allow users to turn off the quacky suggestion feature. I have had to retype stuff so much! Wasted hours  which could have beeb used elsewhere.   I love the Diagram feature. However  I hate the set up. If you label something on the diagram  it gives you the same "term" & "definition" fields. This is great if you indeed need a definition  but if you simply just want to label parts  let us label it and thats it. I hate how you create a diagram and they treat it like a flashcard set! Why not have an option for it to just be a diagram set of labelling parts and thats it?!   All in all  Quizlet has a great platform and potential. But I think the developers are focused on the wrong aspects and not functionality. Because the basics of the app are lacking  but new flashy features keep getting added and it takes away from the potential! I would say Quizlet is great for the following: you are not making your own cards; you are learning simple 1-2 word terms; you don't need formatting/order/neatness; you don't need to study high level topics; you have lots of time to spare for creating personalized functional cards; and if you don't require better study tactics. I love the app  once the cards are made and functional. But I despise the process of creating flashcards on their platform. I am a Plus subscriber  but due to the frustration  I have had to look elsewhere for other apps to see if they have better formatting options. Sometimes its the small things that distract a student from learning and Quizlets formatting features affect visibility and productivity for those with learning issues  vision issues  higher level education (complex material)  and those with things like OCD/OCPD  ADHD etc who require order.","-","3","Great app  but needs better development",3267318693,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id119916104",0

"Heartbroken👨","I’ve been using quizlet for over 8 years now and it’s been helpful overall  until now.  The learning feature on the app makes no sense. You’re instantly quizzed over material  which you may or may not actually know  so you’re basically just guessing random questions— which might help you learn if it’s your native language  but if you’re trying to use the cards for learning a new language  it is completely useless. They should change the title to something else like review quiz or under the quizzes/test section. Because it’s not actually helping you learn if you have 50 plus flash cards in a language you don’t know.  They also need to make an offline version available. I’m a commuter and I haven’t been able to access my cards to study on the way to class just because the cards aren’t available offline. But when I try to see how to make it offline  I can’t find an actual solution to my issue.  It’s a good app. But there’s like small issues that make it basically useless.","-","3","After years of use  it still needs improvement",3249130495,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id343299381",0

"7/3/18","So ever since I dealt with school having autism on my back my teachers hated me. I have to do tons of studying and I mean it. I’m up till about 11:40 at night. They like to use Quizlet as a weapon against me also. As well as my toxic mother and anyone else who wants to see me suffer in school. I think the app is fine. I think it is very successful but people take advantage. It’s hard struggling in school and having to do 8 lessons for 5 hours on Quizlet I just don’t want people to be able to use this app as a weapon against others and I think there should’ve been some sort of security system for the app. To organize maybe classes for teachers and their students. I think these classes should have security and only people invited to a class are allowed to study there. I also think that if a student is studying in a class for over an hour and they are doing fine the whole time that they should be kicked off the lesson to give them a well needed break.

"Wannabe polyglot😉","I am in 9th grade and I have been using Quizlet for more than a year now. In 7th grade I made flash cards by hand for Latin. By the end of the year  I had a six inch thick stack of cards! They all got crumpled and torn. With Quizlet  everything is perfectly organized. I can’t lose them like real cards.   I used this app to study Spanish over the summer so that I could go straight to Spanish 2. I passed the exam with an A  and this is the only app I used to study vocabulary.   Useful features: -multiple study modes -copying decks -folders that hold multiple decks -SHARING WITH FRIENDS (so useful!) -free (unless you want extra features  which are not required)  Improvements: -there should be a feature for combining decks. I made a deck for each chapter of my Spanish textbook  and now I want to be able to combine them all into a giant deck to study all at once. Since this feature doesn’t exist  I have to completely remake 600+ cards. PLEASE MAKE A COMBINE FEATURE I WOULD GIVE THE APP 5 STARS WITH A COMBINE FEATURE!!!  This app has been so helpful and I plan to keep using it throughout high school and college. Thank you so much Quizlet!!!","+","4","Please make a feature to combine sets!",3153603347,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id529683424",1

For example if I am learning from a set of flashcards  it would be amazing if I knew how much time I spend on it a day. It could be broken by learning modality and supmed  and aggrgated also by sets  by folders whatever. For instance  I would like to spend 1 hour a day on Arabic words  if there was a functionality that tells me that  Quizlet would in principle tick all the points I need from it.

I want to be able to look up a term (let’s say “doctor”) and see what card in what deck has the word “doctor” in it. Using the search bar now will just search literally every deck on the web whose title contains “doctor”  or you can search your folder titles for the word “doctor”  but there’s no option to search for individual cards  @Developers please let me know if there’s some obvious button I’m not pushing.

The match feature is great because it’s super quick and you can compete against classmates. Another feature that is great is the learn feature because it determines what things you need to study and what you don’t. The best thing on quizlet is how simple it is to make a “set.” You can literally search any topic at all and it will come up. Then you just press copy and your done! You can also make your own sets! The things that I don’t like about quizlet is when your  using the test feature spelling counts so if you get the answer right but spell it wrong you get it wrong. They should add a spelling doesn’t count setting because I rarely use it for spelling/grammar tests. Overall this app is great because you can share your sets  use all your sets for finals  make a set in a minute and it is super easy to make an account!

I like how easy it is to make sets; it's much easier than creating physical flashcards. My favorite feature is how different translations are integrated for language studies. My minor suggestions would be: 1.) Make "Private Set" the default rather than Public. 2.) In addition to reviewing cards by scrolling  add a "flip to tap" interface as another option to review the cards. It would give users the semblance of using traditional/physical flashcards. 3.) Once or twice the audio feature reads something very different from what I tried on the card (no special characters or weird spacing).

In general  it is a very helpful tool to manage your class and students. With the addition of the ‘material’ option in classwork  it makes it really convenient to post agenda  handouts  or just information if I want to keep record of them (because the posts on the stream gets pushed down over time). However  on the app  the posts always don’t show as its complete version. The posts are always cut off below the first two lines  which makes it very inconvenient for students who use their cellphone to access more often than on a PC. Some of my students don’t have computer access everyday so it makes it really difficult and a little discouraging for them to keep up with all the information provided online  especially when they are all trying to improve their computer/ internet literacy. I truly hope this issue can eventually be resolved in the next few updates.","-","3","Great class management tool but need improvements",3314668781,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id581526666",17

"LuvReading79","I love Google Classroom overall - it has made my job as a teacher so much easier. However  there is a glitch with the app. When I am absent I will use the app on my iPad to go in and post an assignment to all of my classes. At school  on my laptop  I am able to make one post and post it to multiple classes at once. The app allows me to do this  but then when the students actually go to do the work  only the class I made the post in gets the post. All the others either don’t have a post or they have the post but can’t access the attached document. It’s makes a huge mess of the day because I’m not there to realize it’s happened. I figured it out cause it’s happened more than once now. Please fix this glitch in the app - Google Classroom is my most favorite teaching tool ever.","+","5","Love it  but a small glitch",2256334823,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85859381",20

"merlinsyosi","Flanders fields was a rondeau about war  written by a soldier. Its an interesting poem because it kind of switches back and fourth between a beautiful scene of poppies in a field  to people dying in combat. The mood was kind of gloomy  made me a little sad that the nicer things in life couldn’t be appreciated because of war going on around it. We wear the mask was another saddening one  its whole focus is how people cant escape wearing the mask  and how horrible humans are for each-other. And its historical context really makes sense  because while some fought out to try and solve problems with discrimination  some hid their pain under masks to get where the got to.   Change starts within. No leopards spots Can change outside  nor change the plots. Try as you will  it must be pure.  Its your choice  it will not allure.  Changing is hard  it will cause knots  We are destined to fall  fall lots. More if something we want just rots. We see the wrong  we know the cure  Change starts within  Don’t believe me  take all your shots.  Its bound to creep into your thoughts. Even when you think your secure.

I’ve also been hoping to find an app that would automatically remind me when I had an assignment to finish/due. The best part about Google Classroom is I can now see for sure if I’ve done an assignment so if a teacher of mine hasn’t put in the grade yet I can show them it’s on time and that’s it’s done.

The app has also seen numerous bug improvements that help it to feel snappier.

"LuvReading79","I love Google Classroom overall - it has made my job as a teacher so much easier. However  there is a glitch with the app. When I am absent I will use the app on my iPad to go in and post an assignment to all of my classes. At school  on my laptop  I am able to make one post and post it to multiple classes at once. The app allows me to do this  but then when the students actually go to do the work  only the class I made the post in gets the post. All the others either don’t have a post or they have the post but can’t access the attached document. It’s makes a huge mess of the day because I’m not there to realize it’s happened. I figured it out cause it’s happened more than once now. Please fix this glitch in the app - Google Classroom is my most favorite teaching tool ever.","+","5","Love it  but a small glitch",2256334823,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85859381",20

"iOS user12345","Beware! The Download feature does not work well!  First  the app does NOT download the video or audio in the background on wifi so you have to make sure you keep the app open!  Second (and even worse) when you click on "My Talks" then choose downloads  it will show your talk as being downloaded when in fact it isn't! (the talk has only started to download or is only partially downloaded). This means that you will consume a lot of unplanned bandwidth when you try to view the "downloaded" talk (which may cost you a lot of money) or you won't be able to access it all all if you don't have an internet connection.  It's a poorly designed app. They should have a "pending download" section in "My Talks" and enable the app to download in the background when on Wifi.  There should also be a progress bar when the talk is being downloaded.","-","1","Beware! Download feature does not work well!",1971505885,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id106946196",82

One big flaw is when I choose a video to watch and I see on the right hand side another video in “Related Talks” I’m interested to watch afterward there is no way to find it again. Every time I finish the main video the “Related Talks” have changed again and I’m not able to watch the other video I was interested in. Even more so: There is no way to add a video in “Related Talks” to your watch list. That makes actually the “Related Talks” section pointless since I can never get back and watch what was suggested to me.   Please  I would appreciated if you can make it work that the “Related Talk” videos are NOT changing every time I finish a video or add the main video to the watch list but rather that I’m able to go back and be able to watch one of the suggested videos.

One innovative design is that it invites users to choose the length of a playlist   so that people do not need to feel bad because they cannot finish it.  Another innovation is that users can download and bookmark talks and with downloading   for some talks  users can choose to download an audio or a video one.  Very thoughtful.  The icon is clear.

This app does an adequate job of presenting the video and audio but gosh considering the bar is set so very very high for the content you would think the app would at least approach that.   I agree with other comments in some of the reviews. Get play lists   favorites  and history syncing across all the platforms. Also the app should functionally acknowledge on all platforms that in some cases (like driving in your car) only the audio needs to be presented. Dark unobtrusive mode would be nice too. It can't be that TED doesn't know talented folks that could make this app sing.  I mean what's not to like about TED. TED IS AWESOME!

Go back and u have to try to find where you were from the beginning      Turn the screen off to save battery power as you are only listening to the audio - same as above.   Download only the audio version then go to play that selection - you get a big blank screen with a white arrow. So you hit that arrow. 'System error' on every audio you downloaded.  So you go back to that screen and you notice a small message in the lower left corner 'play selection'. That works. Then screen display mode kicks in and you have to start all over again. Again.   Now deal with all this at 70 miles an hour.

There doesn’t seem to be a way to edit one’s forum entry.   ————— prior review ———- I've only taken one course on Coursera so I have only narrow experience. The experience I have though is somewhat negative  but I don't know if the problems lie with the app  or the setup and programming on the back end.  First experience and consequences. As I watched course videos  many times the system did not recognize that I had watched the video  though I had  and had done so many times in hope that a check mark would appear indicating I had completed this step in the course. The result was assignments were marked as overdue.  Second experience. Mini-tests were given  but some items required free form input  but app did not display the iPad keyboard  which meant the question was not answered.  Third experience. Multi-choice items sometimes were rendered as radio button rather than checkboxes  allowing only one choice instead of multiple.","-","3","There are bugs somewhere",3413507204,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16241541",0

There is no button to use to sync after connecting to internet. It is suppsed to happen automatically  but in my case it does NOT happen!

That said  the desktop version is better than this app  which I’ve had continual problems with — crashing  things not loading  and the app incorrectly keeping track of where I am in a course when auditing it. I’ve been using other sites much more because of this (I think that speaks volumes). I have had problems with edX and Udemy but not nearly as bad as with Coursera (both online and off). If you encounter issues like I did  try the website using a desktop computer. I found that much better in many regards. The issue with Coursera not properly tracking progress when you audit a course can be worked around by keeping a browser tab open to the course page with the week you’re working on visible.

Suggestions for improvements: if optional assignments in courses could be differentiated so that the "pick up where you left off" section could skip over those if you've already started/completed assignments after those  it would save a lot of time and actually make that a useful feature. Also  instead of randomly arranging the list of enrolled courses every time the app is opened  it would be nice to have them arranged by last accessed  next assignment due  etc. to save time and make the app a little more user-friendly. Classes also tend to “jump around” while you’re on the page so that  in the time it takes to tap on a course  another one swaps places with it and you’re taken to the wrong page—very frustrating when it happens so often.

"Páty","Coursera is good when you sign up for one course  & one payment only for that course. Then... they keep charging class after class even after you only signed up for one topic out of the entire outline. Their rules are: you pay one topic after the free trial for your certificate. Not an entire year contract  as I was beginning to get billed. I have to wait until next month to see if I am re-billed  and hope my $$ is returned for this extra month I was charged! The fine print said I would only get billed once  for the course I wanted. If I wanted to take the full outline then I'd have to pay the yearly fee  but my point is I ONLY SIGNED UP FOR ONE CERTIFICATE!! So  there's no need for further billing....although they re-billed me again the following month. :( Very disappointing for my pocket! Scam app  report to remove ASAP! Took my money even though I wasn’t using their course anymore  and I’m very upset. Take Coursera down!

Quizzes sometimes have significant issues with layout  especially if options include formulas or just long text. They also don’t handle orientation change well. And after processing answer show exploding animations 2. Video player is a bit out of date. No easy way to fast forward for 10/15 seconds. changing playback speed is iterative  with no option to quickly switch back to slower rate. Please take a look at modern iOS 11 player or at YouTube player. They have all these issues solved. 3. Video’s audio stream bitrate sometimes is so low so it is impossible to understand anything. With bad network you still have to wait to precache to get better quality. So this option of super low bitrate doesn’t give much to end users  except frustration (many forum topics talk about this audio quality  but moderators provide useless suggestions to tune equalizer)","+","4","Good classes  somewhat buggy app with strange animations",2077749820,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id255245489",0

Then... they keep charging class after class even after you only signed up for one topic out of the entire outline. Their rules are: you pay one topic after the free trial for your certificate. Not an entire year contract  as I was beginning to get billed. I have to wait until next month to see if I am re-billed  and hope my $$ is returned for this extra month I was charged! The fine print said I would only get billed once  for the course I wanted. If I wanted to take the full outline then I'd have to pay the yearly fee  but my point is I ONLY SIGNED UP FOR ONE CERTIFICATE!! So  there's no need for further billing....although they re-billed me again the following month. :( Very disappointing for my pocket! Scam app  report to remove ASAP!

"Alfred3rd","The Coursera app is a really great and convenient way to consume the Coursera MOOCs. I really like the ability to play lectures at accelerated speed in order to get to the point quicker. I also really appreciate the ability to download lectures for off-line viewing.   There are a few quirks that they are in the process of working out. The most annoying  for me  was the inability to display mathematical symbols. This prevented me from taking quizzes or exams on the app. However  I think a recent update may have fixed this issue.  Also  it would be nice to be able to pinch zoom to get a closer look at formulas  images  or text. When the formulas did start working  some of them would render very small on my iPhone 5S screen. I have good eyesight  but it was painstaking work to ensure I was seeing the right subscripts in order to pick my answer.

A few days ago I completed El Camino Primitivo here in Spain and those two minutes of sweet music brought to an emotional close what transpired internally during those 26 days of mostly solitude in the Spanish mountains.

You can't enroll in a course on mobile  even though there's no good reason for this. They pretend you can do quizzes on mobile but it's even worse than you not being able to. They tease you along and let you take half the quiz. Then they throw a question at you that references a picture or chart required to answer the question  except it fails to load. So you either forfeit the question or have to restart the quiz. You go to your computer ( assuming you have one ) and your work is gone  you have to restart the quiz.

Closing the app and starting it back up does nothing.   If you scroll through the lectures in the course  suddenly the view becomes all messed up. As an example  Section 5’s title gets replaced with Section 22’s title.  Many times fast forwarding and moving to the next lecture just shows the spinner spinning forever and doesn’t load the lecture at all.

"Robottalk","I’ve been loving Udemy’s course offerings. Some very interesting topics and excellent teachers. However  I use my iPad for many tasks in Udemy and it’s definitely got some issues that I hope the dev team can address soon. It would be great to be able to run the Udemy app side by side with another app in Split View or pop the video out into PiP. This feature would be a huge advantage when writing code or notes while watching Udemy tutorial videos  etc. The other issue is to that sometimes the video numbering in a course will be incorrect in the display. It will display sometimes 2 or 3 of the same video and it can be difficult to figure out where you are in the curriculum (especially if you jump back and forth between videos).   Overall though Udemy has a great academic offering and in cases where I need the above functionality I end up reverting to their website and using Safari’s existing Split View and PiP functions.","-","3","Decent app but needs iPad Split View or PiP video function",3464290935,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id39603082",0

Sometimes the next video in the course would play automatically.  Other times  not. Need to restart app to restore functionality sometimes. Would also like to see it updated to support newer devices such as the 2018 iPad Pro I am using.  Would also like to see some of the functionalities such as the playback speed and captioning options made more easily accessible (e.g.  directly on the screen overlay along with the playback buttons).  I believe these functions are used often enough given the nature of the contents (i.e.  training courses) that they deserve to be in a more accessible location rather than behind another menu.

"HymanZHAN","Just tried it on my new 12.9-inch iPad and found some weird problems:  - (Appeared also on my old 9.7-inch iPad) Whenever I tried to view the promotion video of a new course  which I have not purchased  I would come to a vertical view after I finished and returned to the course info page  even though I was in horizontal view before I clicked into the promo video. The iPad itself has been sitting horizontally all the time. This has been happening for at least 1 yr now as far as I remember  so pls fix this.  - Neither go-forward (forward 15s) nor go-back (back 15s) on-screen button is working. I tabbed multiple times but nothing happened. The problem persisted even after I relaunch the app. This has not occurred on my 9.7-inch iPad so it might be specific to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.  Please fix the bugs. Thanks.","-","2","Some weird glitches",3415808616,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id560611186",0

"Arshstl","Poor quality iOS application. Here are the issues 1) feature for downloading courses for offline access is very badly designed and takes a long time to download any courses 2) The size of the downloads is huge and takes up lot of space on the iPhone and other iOS devices. Offline downloads should be compressed for improving download times and space used on the devices. For example  similar learning apps like the one from Linux Academy have very quick course download times 3) App is not very responsive. Listing the courses after launching the app sometimes takes 15-30 seconds over regular WiFi connections. I am surprised by such a point quality app for such a great learning portal like Udemy.

Unfortunately I can’t give it a good review because the app makes it very difficult to access the great content.

Sometimes everything works perfectly giving me a glimpse of the experience I could be having (except the download feature).  Today’s experience has been the most frustrating because no amount of closing the app and reopening it has helped  it still refuses to load the video.

"mryan18","I think Udemy has some of the best courses out there in order to learn just about anything. However  I have to rate the app 2-stars as I have two major concerns.  1. Picture in Picture is unavailable on the iPad. This is a huge inconvenience as most of the other apps out there allow this feature. When you are taking a course  it is crucial to take notes. If you are using an iPad to take a Udemy course it is only natural that you would be taking notes on your iPad with an Apple Pencil. Without the picture in picture feature  this is impossible. Therefore  9.5/10 I am having to use the web version on my computer and take notes on my iPad instead.   2. Downloaded content has a bug where sometimes the content isn’t really downloaded. This is a major pain especially on iPads as most iPad owners do not have cellular access so it can make it very frustrating when you are traveling and you realize your items haven’t downloaded.  I would be very happy to see the Picture in Picture feature resolved!

"Not Inigo Montoya","The good:  I’d say Udemy is designed impressively  giving me a sense of organization that no other courses app has given me. I’d also say that the multitude of courses available on Udemy is the best of any other app I’ve used.   The terribly bad: I’ve spent over $40 on courses with Udemy  optimistic about learning. However  it is impossible for me to get through a single video without experiencing a conglomeration of multiple glitches that halts my focus and brings my progress to a standstill. Videos pause randomly after every couple of seconds  causing need to have to close the app and open it back up again just to get them going only for them to stop once again. Course is full on disappear from my courses list and once again force me to restart the app. Even with reliable Wi-Fi  the videos often load only a couple of seconds of video after minutes of loading.   Overall the multitude of courses available with Udemy offer it great potential  but the non-stop software glitches I have experienced alone Have me telling people to use a different course offering the app instead.","-","3","Great courses!

"SolveThisNeedUpdate","- When you go my courses tab and browse one of your purchased courses in mobile app  there is no link to go to the author profile for looking his/her other courses. You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses   a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it.   - When you look for a new course  you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign  you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section  it says after showing some section  “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial  this number depends on the course. Anyway  when you click this link to see whole section  there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section  I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option. This is more user friendly.

Also  re: the developer’s response (dated July 16 but received on Sept 6)  I always find it ridiculous when a user / customer is asked to fill out some feature request forms separately. Don’t you already have the bug information after reading my review? Can’t you fill in an internal form yourself? Getting more and more annoyed with Udemy after this lazy and sloppy customer “service”.  20190715: Videos can still be quite slow to load. Download buttons seem to work now so that’s great  but the 15 seconds buttons still don’t work in full screen mode.   You cannot see the name of the video you’re watching unless you minimise it to the bottom bar. Quite inconvenient when you are rewatching lectures.  Bookmarks do not work at all; there is no way to place bookmarks in a video on the iPad  and bookmarks that have already been created on desktop are not visible at all. Very poor design.  Hope Udemy will continue to improve!  20190712: 1. Videos are slow to load even though I have a fast broadband connection. I sometimes have to play with my phone to pass the time while I wait for the videos to load on my iPad.  2. The per-video download buttons don’t always work.  3.

They gave me no valid explanationnor told me for how long my account was suspended or what could be done for my account to be reopened.

I only purchased 5 courses with my hard-earned money (over $50) on their official sales  and enrolled in 2 courses with coupons over about half a year. And i did/do not spam or pestered instructors or anything that nearly violate the terms of use.  I contacted them through the Online Chat window on their site  the supporter said “we leave no emails unanswered”. What a lie! Until now i still do not know why my account was suspended or for how long  and received no support whatsoever.

You can lose out on deals if the purchase doesn't go through so this is a huge deal.  You can only reach support through the app or site. No phone calls and they respond when you are asleep at 4 am with copy and paste answers.  User interface is lacking  I cannot follow up with messages on my support ticket. I had no choice to ask Apple for a refund after a lack of response to my statements that I had already provided information given TWICE.  Other than horrible problem  app is okay but I would avoid use due to the quality of support and lack of honoring purchases. Other important features missing.

"K-Sp33d","Great courses and great instructors on Udemy!  Requests:  1. Add multitask/split view; to take notes  code along  or look up references  2. Many courses come with exercises and/or lecture notes  not that it's hard  but an annoyance that you need through a couple of steps and then correlate which resources belong to the video.  Why not just put the link under the video title or swipe the current track to display the files (or some other method).  3. Better video player; touch to play/pause  better rewind/forward controls (perhaps gesture control)  auto-subtitles (or transcript)  speed/pitch control. Add controls from the keyboard for when you're typing. When in fullscreen mode  I can touch the 15s forward/reverse and nothing happens.","+","4","Udemy is Great  iOS app could use improvement",3054842199,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id44022443",0
"Grazillion","This should’ve got 5 stars as it does most of what I need it to do...with one major exception: It doesn’t allow for split-screen when being used on an iPad.  I typically take notes on the right side of the screen with either Evernote or OneNote (depending if I need to write or type)  and I keep whatever I’m learning on the left side of the screen.  That can’t be done with this app. Instead  I have to go to the Udemy website in Chrome  request desktop mode  and use split screen from there.  I have a 12.9” iPad Pro that can easily handle a video being played at a decent size on one side of the screen and a note app on the other side. The screen is not much different from a 13” MacBook Pro screen. But even if I had one of the smaller iPads  I should still be able to view this is split-screen.  To the developers: Please  make it so that the app plays well with Apple’s split screen functionality. That way I could use it without having to resort to the browser.","-","3","This should’ve got 5 stars but...",3050927508,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id310698618",0

"Sir Damato III","I absolutely love Udemy  but app offline download is useless. It downloads out of sync  and it downloads sporadically. It simply does not act the way you would expect it to. In other words a foundational experience issue.   I was forced to go on holiday with limited access  and less than half a specific course videos I was interested. It would have been fine if the course videos that did download was not so randomly few and far between. It could at least have downloaded in sequence.   When you select to download the course  that’s what you would expect it to do. Yet 24 hours later  only 10 videos of 80 having been downloaded I was forced to cancel  as nothing else is happening. So I tried downloading section by section  and it seems to chuck videos away that was downloaded. I abandoned the exercise.  Only when downloading one by one (yes some people are that desperate)  then it seems to work. Was terribly disappointed to be honest.  Will update review once app is fixed  because Udemy is awesome otherwise!","-","1","Love Udemy  but app offline download is useless.",2065713485,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id162065948",0

For example  when I close my Smart Cover (which turns my iPad off) after a couple moments a course will suddenly start playing.  2.  When viewing a video  the scroll along the bottom of the video is very hard to use.  It’s difficult to “grab” the place indicator.   3.  Although likely not a function of the app  there is a lot of lag between starting courses and moving to different spots within the course.    In summary  the courses are great!

Normalized reviews and pricing -  some awfully high /inflated ratings and prices for rather basic courses with sparse content  or content that is no longer current.   Perhaps a rating score for the raters and some price guides could also help.   2.  Simpler method of categorizing /organizing/labeling  content already purchased to make better buying decisions 3.  Indications of enrolled  wish-listed for courses  on the upper tier of course selection without opening each course and thus more quickly make buying decisions. 4.  Repeating / allowing access to original course  goals / info to enable better course evaluations  find other instructor courses  ... etc. 5.  Enable / assist instructors to provide college  business  professional course instruction with certification. 6.  Provide access to  archived audio/video lectures from colleges  or business seminars etc. 7.

"miya361","I bought a few courses on the last sale and so far things work ok. Udemy itself makes it easy for users to return a course and get a refund quickly – if you bought the course through the website and not through the app. Luckily I realized that before I bought a course. There should be an option to purchase a class with credit card or paypal through the app to get rid of the hassle. And there is a big bug  at least in one of my courses. When I try to open pdf documents from the resources  I often only get a grey screen that says “original pdf document”. The documents worked before  so I don’t know  what the problem is. Sometimes restarting the app works  but not always. If I can’t access the documents important to my class  it makes no sense to use the app.","-","3","Good  but...",2475460642,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id244986212",1

"Josephpizzo","The Udemy App has become an essential tool in career development for me. I have downloaded and used several courses both in part (for specific topics) or in the course entirety.  I have suggested this to anyone and everyone. It can become an essential tool for entering a specific field  learning a new skill or to gather ideas how to accomplish a goal.  One suggestion I have is to add some type of bookmarking or tagging feature. If I could tap my screen and tag or bookmark a specific topic  it would be a time saver and probably keep me in the app longer. I’d like to tap my video screen  tap an icon for bookmarking or tagging  enter some relevant text and have those saved as reference points that I could scroll or search and get access to the portion of the lesson or course that I would like.

"PowerObject!","This used to be on ok app and now it is in the dumps. I’m using iPad Air 2 with the latest iOS 11 and all the apps up to date.  I reported some serious bugs in the last 2 years and NONE of them are fixed so far - not to mention they added NEWER bugs to the app which were also reported to them last year and still  none of them are resolved even though they acknowledged the bugs. This is so FRUSTRATING!!!  It doesn’t download courses in the background and we have to keep the app in the foreground and keep tapping the screen so the device dies not go to sleep and stop downloads.  The downloaded chapters do NOT play offline - even if I turn on the cellular data for this app (as also reported by many users in these reviews and acknowledged by Udemy in these reviews). How difficult is it to play the DOWNLOADED courses sitting on the local device - when a browser can play live online?  If I remove some chapter/section (because it does not play offline) and try to redownload them  it doesn’t even download them - leave alone playing offline. What a pity!  Going into full screen turns the video upside down for no reason.  No way to come out of full screen as they added a white bar on the bottom that covers the controls such as play  pause  full screen  etc and these controls are not visible or accessible (how difficult is it to delete this stupid white bar??).  No progress bar to scroll to a particular position in the video. No way to go to the beginning of the video. I cannot keep pressing 15 seconds back to go to the beginning. Pressing |< goes to the previous video.  No speed  captions or other controls that exist in their we app.  No way to see reviews of purchased courses until logged out. I want to see reviews and ratings in case I purchase multiple courses on the same subject to decide which one to learn first.  No way to mark a course as Favorite for quick access.  No way to sort courses in most recently purchased or most recently accessed  etc order. How hard is it to add another filter option to an EXISTING feature? It is just a tiny where clause filter to SQL and a link in the app to that filter! I have purchased hundreds of courses and it becomes a challenge to wade through every time I need to find a course I purchased because even the newly purchased courses can appear at the end or somewhere in the middle of the list!  Many more bugs to list here (reported all of these and they verified and acknowledged the issues but did not resolve them in 2+years) but these are CRUCIAL issues they chose to IGNORE and not resolve. What they need is a new IT leader and a QA person who understand the seriousness of bugs. Their incapable and dumb programmers - who cannot even think - seem to be capable of keeping their jobs!  Seriously  what’s the point of having an app that can download chapters for offline viewing but does not play them?? Or does not redownload them? I encourage you all users to give this app 1 STAR rating along with a BAD review until they wake up from their slumber  move their butts and resolve these issues as they do not seem to look at their bug log anymore. We’ll revise our review after the issues are resolved. They have 60 thousand courses - why not they learn from those courses how to code  how to fix bugs  how to test or manage an IT project?? This is ridiculous!!! This app is a piece of GARBAGE and BS.  It does not take YEARS to resolve simple issues - it only shows they would take our money but are not interested in fixing the issues. They don’t have programmers to fix the issues - al they do is post canned responses acknowledging the issues. That’s all it is - not a rocket science.

"Ollie C.","Tl;dr: Great courses  bad app (slow  buggy  broken downloads  no split-screen)  There’s some great content on Udemy  but unfortunately  the app is so buggy that it isn’t worth the download at this point.   I’m running the app on a 2017 iPad Pro (iOS 11  not jailbroken) with a decent internet connection to boot  and it is painfully slow. The app takes several minutes to launch  and when it finally does launch  it cannot load any of my content despite the app continually refreshing itself (which is utterly annoying if I leave the app for say 30 seconds to send a text message). I have had this app for all of a day and had to reinstall it twice just to view my courses. The videos are continually buffering  and I have to quit the app several times throughout a 10-minute clip just to finish it! I find that absurd when on this same iPad I'm able to stream two-hour long  HD  HDR videos with no issues while doing something else. As for downloads  they are non-existent. I tried to download a few lectures for my flight yesterday  and despite showing they were offline ready  I couldn't get any of them to load. They still won’t even though I’m online and did a clean install.   Between the constant buffering  broken downloads  lack of split-screen functionality  and general unresponsiveness  the Udemy app is unusable for me. My recommendation is to use the browser version of Udemy and run video PIP if your device is capable of doing so. That won’t solve your offline issues  but you’ll be able to draw along if you’re in an art course like me.","-","2","The App Isn’t Worth Using As Is",2367713121,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id161961100",0

"MIGerlag97","I’ve reviewed numerous apps over time and you guys are one of very few developers that actually respond  I appreciate that  thank you. For what it’s worth I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because at least you guys interact with your users. I’ll be more than happy to give a great review and full 5 stars when the app itself is sorted out.  Original Review: (1 Star) I downloaded an entire course on my iPad for me to be able to watch it at times when I can’t connect to WiFi.   Half the videos that indicate they are downloaded will not play  I just get a stupid loading wheel. Now it won’t even play anymore when it’s reconnected to WiFi.  The entire iPad app is trash  is mostly a stretched out phone app  I’d like to be able to view a list of videos in a course without having one of them play whenever I open the course. Separate the media player from the video list.  The entire UI is awkward. The now playing bar thing on the bottom is cumbersome and not suited a a large screen iPad experience. The download feature is awkward to use  some sort of download manager would be nice.  It would also be nice to have picture in picture mode available for videos so that I can take notes with my Apple Pencil in another app.  The udemy content is good  but the app is not.

It kept flashing a message about login expired and clearing cached content. The only way to get back to the class was to login again.

"Antsy Pantsy 9000","Udemy is great overall. Good content but problematic when it comes to downloading course content offline 😳.  Downloads don’t always complete and are unavailable even when it seems like they may have downloaded. This is a major pain point for travelers who don't have internet access when traveling and just want to take the course. Might be a UX issue though.  Suggestions :   1. Please add a clear download status % indicator for each item. A percentage indicator might work better.  2. Enable true offline access (currently cannot access downloaded udemy without internet access at all).  3. clearly show which downloads are complete and which aren't. Currently the app makes it look like everything is downloaded but once you're without WiFi  the course content is unavailable. A clear download % status would fix this issue. Could change from a red downwards pointing arrow (which is meant to indicate a "downloaded item") to a green tick mark  which makes more sense.  Overall a great service and helpful educational resource.

"SciArts","Udemy is a great site whose experience and usefulness is degraded by the flaws of its crippled mobile apps. I have it installed on multiple devices on both Android and iOS and the flaws I’ve experienced are essentially identical on both. The app won’t actually download anything for offline use. In Android it switches off SD card use and spins its wheels as it were.   On iOS  it’s even worse. It actually lies to you. It spends however many minutes or hours pretending to download whatever you’ve selected  indicating gradual progress  and eventually completing all while never actually downloading anything at all. I’ve verified this in settings; available storage never decreases.  You can’t add or remove favorites in the app anymore either. This is deeply ANNOYING if you have a sizable library like I do.  Honestly  it feels like some jerk web programmer who doesn’t know Java or Swift sold them on the idea of making a nonnative app with web technologies. This is the kind of dog poop that normally results from those kinds of decisions.

I took a few courses on Udemy so this is based on dozens of hours of interacting with the app. It is very glitchy  oftentimes slow or not working at all on an otherwise perfect wifi  not always remembers where you left off  serving podcasts as videos with a static picture etc. etc. One other thing is the subtitles which are automatically generated subs and of very low quality  sometimes to the point if being completely incomprehensible or very misleading. While autogenerated subtitles are ok for  say  youtube  for a platform which strives to be a leader in online education this is unacceptable.
