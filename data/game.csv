"Reed🍊","Update: I’m now on level 171. It requires me to get 10 striped candies in 12 moves. That’s ridiculous. I’ve been on this level for days and I’ve wasted boosters. I don’t see any way I’m ever going to pass this level unless I get incredibly lucky with the board. Please add more moves. The levels should be challenging  but they shouldn’t be near impossible.  -  It’s a fun game and a good way to pass time on the subway or waiting for an appointment. Overall I like it  I just have two suggestions: 1. Add an option to turn off hints. Most of the time they’re not actually helpful  but just a distraction. For example  every time there’s a color bomb on the board the game wants me to use it. Often times I’m saving the bomb for a later move but the game won’t stop telling me to use it now. 2. Add a confirmation for buying things with gold bars. Earlier today I failed a level and I accidentally pressed the button to pay for more moves. I wasted 10 bars. Just a simple “This will cost 10 bars. Continue?” with a yes button and a cancel button would be helpful.","-","2","Changed to 2 stars",3535516438,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id947747941",0

It is impossible to get 100 greens in 32 moves because 100 greens do not appear on such a small board. This level in 32 moves does not appear on the tips or cheat apps so I’m stuck.","+","4","Stuck on level 456",3533739995,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id218121087",0

Disable people and retired people don’t have the money to buy all your little gold bars and with making some of the levels impossible to win you only get 3 chances to try because you take the lives away....SHAME on you  maybe the other people that are new and haven’t been playing for 6+ years will make you even more millions","-","3","Unreal.......so sad",3533486289,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id250191335",0

"Awesomeawsome","For those of you who wonder why I continue to play this crap game it’s because I just want you to be informed. The level I’m in now. I’ve repeatedly made the move  it should have wiped out the target and it didn’t! How can it work for 1201 levels but not work in this level?  I crossed a strip and a wrapped not far below the target and in any other level that move would have deleted the target. Many many times in this level the target should have been deleted but it’s not. Do not spend your money on this game.  Lots of things in different levels. Been in this level too long. I should have beat it long ago. IWANT ALL MY BOOSTERS BACK!! CCS STOLE ALL MY BOOSTERS! LOTS OF BOOSTERS!!! I play on two different devices.  But different accounts. On my ipad the game stuck me on the same level over and over and over. Nothing worked to get it going. Nothing! So I deleted and reinstalled it. It’s not stuck anymore but where are all the boosters I had and i had really a lot of boosters.  So now its got me stuck on the same level on this device and I’d be willing to bet just about  well willing to bet if I delete it on this device they’re going to steal all my boosters and I have more on this device then i HAD on the other device.  Candy Crush Saga is a rip off game. DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS APP! ~Level 1202.  Lots of funky stuff in this game. In this level the most annoying thing was when I shot thru two jellies  two layers  one on top of each other  4 times  and it did nothing! 4 freaking times!

"CatPenguin291","I love Candy Crush who doesn’t. But the game should be less addictive as it is. I played about 20 levels this morning and they were not easy. What I don’t like is that they only sometimes gives you boosts and such when you don’t to bribe you into the game. Something positive I should say is I love how the game is basically telling a story in candy land. The main character Tiff helps animals. I like that the challenges get harder as you go but not too hard that is good so you adapt and don’t notice how much harder they are compared from 80 to 1. And I like the contests because it’s fun to compete with people even if you don’t know them. I am really competitive so of course I do. I hate how they advertise other games by the company in the game because for their own sake people are going to stop playing cause of these adds. The gold bars are great when you have them but unfortunately they go away or spent very quickly that is.

One thing  the game doesn’t give you the pieces to reach the goal. I’m in level 19?? And I’m supposed to knock all the blocks  all the black blocks and chocolate. I’m able to break both blocks but the game doesn’t give me the chocolate to break and I lose all my lives trying to beat the level.

"Wellmyothernicknamewastaken","First off the game is not a bad game it can be fun. Some levels are easier than others but it can be quite simple which is not bad. However  there are WAY to many in game pop ups that happen after each level or just getting into the app. You have to go through at least 5 things whether it’d be closing or pressing the okay button. Some of the pop ups you have to wait for them to load or go through a little story. At first this way okay but when you just want to play the levels back to back it takes up to much time. I just want to play the game not exit or wait for some little animal to eat it’s food.","-","2","Way to many in game pop ups",3505558477,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id289297148",0

The buddy system and the implementation of rare candy make it easier to get candies for some Pokémon you can’t always find in the wild.

"Dreaming Jirachi","I have to say that I am impressed with how much this game has grown! However  I am experiencing some difficulties with my coins. I have had several Pokémon come back from gyms and it said that they reached the daily limit of 50 coins  but they are not appearing and I have stayed at the same amount of coins that I have. Also  I find it extremely irritating when I go out of my way to visit a Pokéstop and when I eventually get to spin it  I am told to “Try Again Later” for unknown reasons. The range for them are ridiculous as well! I can be standing at the door of the establishment that the Pokéstop is located and my character will be walking away and out of range.

First of all when doing the field and special research why do you put something in there to do which is impossible to do  esp excellent curveball throw now I have to do two of them for two different special research. I’ll never finish those and trying to catch some Pokémon only to have it bounce out and using a numerous amount of balls and then it runs away. That is really frustrating. Also why say catch certain Pokémon when they stop appearing for the researches is it possible to spawn Pokémon so the researches can be finished and move on to the next one.","+","4","Great game",3535655456,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id124808495",0

You and your retarded idea of programming Pokemon go that screwed over Pokemon go player. You could at least let us use other pokeball to catch a legendary Pokemon if the lame premier ball run out.

"A Wise Man Once Said:","I have loved the Pokémon universe for as long as I can remember  and just like everyone else  when Pokémon go hit the App Store I was enthralled. However  after about 3 weeks me and my wife hit “the wall.”   It was to grindy with not enough rewards or player interaction. So we left for 2 years.  Someone at work inspired me to download it again so me and my wife activated our old accounts and gave it a shot. We noticed a HUGE difference! Different game all together. So to sum up the major differences I have put together a small list to help you jump right in:  1. There are Pokémon literally EVERYWHERE! There is nearly 5 times more Pokémon to catch than when the game first launched. It allows me to play from home a lot more. I find myself logging in and catching Pokémon right on my bedroom when I’m not even planning on going outside. Terrific! There is also a much larger Pokémon pool to catch.  2. Friend system  daily gifts  trading system  training system  battle system  raids  daily quests  special quests  quest earned mythical encounters  and adventure sync (ability to accumulate steps while not playing). All of these systems have expanded the game into something better. It will be the reason we play for years and years.  3. The variety of special Pokémon! Pokémon in holiday hats  ultra rare shines Pokémon  abnormal element typed Pokémon. I hatched a Sandshrew that is steel/ice type. He looks a lot different and learns different attacks. Super cool! It adds a sense of uniqueness between one player and another and makes trading Pokémon a lot more desirable.   Thank you for launching all the of the essential updates. We really enjoy playing Pokémon Go!","+","5","3 Reasons Pokemon Go won back my alligence",3534973324,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id895279587",0

I could throw a Razz Berry on a common 400 cp Pokémon  use and ultra ball  achieve a great throw  and it will still escape before the third bounce. Sometimes that will happen a few times. I don’t know if it’s just I’m unlucky with the actual catch percentage or what but it gets very frustrating wasting away ultra balls on a Pokémon I didn’t even want that bad.

"my Mustang","The game is great majority of the time. When it’s not its logs out randomly  makes you walk in a different direction and the spoofers.   I personally like the game compared to other games out there. Don’t know if it’s because I’m an original Pokémon fan from the 90’s or people just bandwagon from game to game (like Fortnite  Minecraft  Clash  Roblox and similar). I understand that the games have down times or might get boring for a month period but it doesn’t mean that you should follow everyone to a particular game.   The reason I think the numbers of players are down slightly or some is due to the decrease of rare spawns. I personally like the game now because you have a variety of Pokémon spawning. You have a few rare spawns with some good evolution spawns (great stardust) and the different generations spawning. The game before was like catch a Rare spawn then the next street over catch another rare spawn and then do for awhile.   A few features that are needed or could be improved is:  1) limiting or completely removing the spoofers. By limiting the spoofers it means removing gyms from their games  no friends feature and limit of 30 Pokémon caught a day.  2) Offer discounts or promotions at different places that are Pokéstops or gyms. Most times people just spin a Pokéstop and keep going or do a battle/raid at a gym then leave.  3) Have the nearby feature but add the “wild” feature if you are in a busy Pokéstop area.  4) Have raids happen at night too. Some work during the day or some people are night people and might want to get out at that time. 5) With the big events (such as Safari Zone) is have a change of place each year. I know that the Community Days are great fillers but the issue is that people can’t always take time off to go to Chicago or Japan or wherever.  6) Weather Boosted Pokémon categories should be equal. Most times to all the time the weather boost caters to 1 maybe 2 types of Pokémon.","-","3","Needs a few improvements",3530915908,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id544548383",0

"adorablebadass","You’d think after 2 years of doing this  Niantic would have figured it out by now. I’m new to Pokemon in general. I didn’t grow up watching it or playing it but I was really excited to play but the glitches!!!   I was most excited for trainer battles which I suspect is the mischief behind all the glitches. However I was extremely disappointed to find out that you have to scan other trainers. There’s absolutely no way I’m going to go ask strangers at a coffee shop if they play pokémon and want to battle.  I had hoped other trainers ready for battle would show up in the nearby section  kind of sending out a beacon to other trainers saying “hey I’m here too and wanna battle”. There’s just no way I can actually battle with other trainers without having to find leagues and find others who are willing to battle at their convenience instead of just finding random players in my area already ready to go. I don’t think enough thought about the average player who doesn’t run in pokemongo crowds was put into this. It’s like the game forces you to find other players on your own who can battle at the same times you want to","-","3","Too many glitches and trainer battles were anticlimactic",3530886438,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id274438965",0

"afbasile","The App Store page for this app does not disclose that the publisher blocks access to many of the most popular features to accounts registered to children under age 13. Such popular features include: - Pokemon trading - Friendships with other players (Trainers)  and related in-game benefits (Lucky Pokemon  7-km eggs featuring special Pokémon  gift exchanges with friends  etc.) - New Trainer Battles (no player vs. player when you can’t make friends in-app...) - Sponsored Poke Gyms (often home to special activities such as EX Raids)  The publisher offers no way for parents to opt-in to these features on behalf of their children (or themselves  when using their kids’ accounts).    Niantic Kids was announced over the summer as a way for parents to manage accounts. That feature is apparently only available to new registrants  isn’t available to existing account holders  and doesn’t include the opt-in feature that users are asking for.   Meanwhile  children’s accounts can easily make in-app purchases without obtaining parental consent.   The unfortunate result is that children and their parents who truthfully disclose their actual dates of birth when opening their accounts are penalized  and the app creates an incentive for parents to encourage their kids to lie about their age.","-","1","Significant  Undisclosed Limits on Kids’ Accounts",3529740658,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28559715",0

"Frosty Carr","I’ve been playing Pokémon go since it released back in 2016. I’ve seen how Niantic has mad drastic changes to the game making it more appealing and easier to use. Generally they are pretty good about fixing in game bugs that give others issues. I just wish that on the switch  Pokémon could go both ways not just to the switch and stuck there. I think adding the switch would be an amazing way to get some of those lower level Pokémon way up there in cp. but maybe they’ve anticipated that and think it could wreck the game in some way. Either way this game is awesome. Gave 3 stars because sometimes when it updates I have to completely delete Pokémon go and reinstall it to get it to not crash.","-","3","Nestalgic but buggy",3527190650,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101476195",0

The fact that it has received continuous support since it’s launch has created a game that is constantly “evolving!” The love of the lvl 40 trainers has shown to Niantic that this game is worth the love that they are showing it. I buy about $30 a month from the store. I show my love with my financial support. I hope this game continues to grow an become a better experience everyday. Trading  PvP have breathed new life into this game! If you haven’t played since launch I suggest you try it now as it doesn’t even compare.

"ImbuedPhoenix45","Love this game! Been playing it since launch  and it gets better and better over time. This is game is simply  amazing without a doubt. However  I believe it can get even better! To improve upon this already great game  here are a few new features I believe many fans would appreciate being added to the game as an potential update sometime in the near future:  1. More choices for avatar customization - More hair styles and colors  - More skin tones - more facial features    a. character/trademark masks/costumes/etc.   b. more sizes/shapes/styles of noses  eyes  mouths  chin  ears  etc.   c. more body types     > heavy     > athletic      > skinny     > average      > other   d. ability to change your avatar’s height     > The ability to change your avatar’s battle team (maybe only once every 3 months or so) - Valor to Mystic/Instinct - Mystic to Valor/Instinct  - Instinct to Valor/Mystic 3. Ability to request/vote for the addition of new poké-stop and gym locations (most certainly in states/regions/cities/townships/rural areas where there really aren’t many poké-stop locations or gyms within walking distance of local residents) 4. Allowing players to view areas very far away from their current location  - ability to scroll and zoom in/out to view poké-stops and gyms in other states  providences  cities  and countries around the world   a. when viewing gyms outside a 2 mile radius of your current location:     > allow players the ability to view the Pokémon and their respective CP levels  current raid bosses/live timers  and the team who is currently in control of that gym     > allow players to send berries to to a damaged Pokémon from far away (maybe only one or a maximum of one berry/per day is allowed to be sent to a trainer’s Pokémon from far away similar to how special trades are allowed only once per day) 5. Ability to skip dialogue during research tasks 6. Ability to skip animations such as evolution animations  hatching egg animations  leveling up animations  and trading animations  etc.  7. Ability to chat      > w/ friends     > w/ other players during raid battles      > with a code for a online chatroom 8. etc.   These are a few features I’d like to see being added to the game and I can confirm that I’m not really the only person who wants these features to be added. There are many fans out there who are probably in agreement with me that many of the aforementioned features should be added to the game to make it more enjoyable than it is now.   Just a few suggestions to consider. No big deal if they aren’t added to the game  but it would be a bummer if they weren’t because many of my friends have told me they would very much like these suggestions to be considered and added as soon as possible. Nevertheless  still a fantastic game and I will continue to play it regardless of whether or not any more changes are made to the game. Lastly  I thank you for your time  and have a great rest of your day/night! Gotta catch ‘em all!","+","5","Suggestions",3521790338,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id571634268",0

I throw a ball  and it the game exits the battle and freezes. These same glitches haven’t been fixed in over a year  and they are not even more frequent than before.  Avoid this thing at all cost.

For some Pokémon  it takes 400 candies to evolve them  and those Pokémon don’t show up often enough so it takes forever to get enough. The updates are awesome  especially since they’re adding Alola forms of Pokémon.

"Lu adjust","This game had a rocky start. It was super popular and the servers couldn’t handle it. Now the developers push a new event almost all the time. Getting mew was fun and challenging(Ditto). Celebi and Spiritomb were arduous to obtain but Meltan has been extremely challenging because I don’t have a Nintendo switch. They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pokémon in a very creative way.  I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps.  Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn’t ruin it and trading rare Pokémon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it’s cheap.  The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn’t ever forced to buy anything and it isn’t like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live.  In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play. I can’t wait to see what they bring to the game next year.","+","5","Should be called PokemonGo 2.0",3512274607,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id9148791",3

If your service isn’t strong in a lot of areas  it could be hard to play because it does require significant data. Also  for those that say they make you pay money and it’s hard to get poke balls  very often they live in a backwoods area  I have never had much of a problem with this if I go out and spin poke stops for 20 minutes.  That being said  this is a wonderful game that has gotten me and my friends out of our houses and having a good time. The continuation of updates ever improve the game  whether it’s research tasks (which totally keeps me occupied) or trading. And for those that say they can’t find Pokémon? It’s a challenge!

"SquirtleGirl","I’m one of the few girls who is obsessed with Pokémon  and when this came out  my Pokémon world was complete. I could go anywhere (with WiFi)  catch Pokémon  and even make friends with fellow PKMN Goers. One thing I don’t like about it is that you have to collect “candies” for Pokémon to evolve. For some Pokémon  it takes 400 candies to evolve them  and those Pokémon don’t show up often enough so it takes forever to get enough. The updates are awesome  especially since they’re adding Alola forms of Pokémon. I really recommend getting this app  you won’t get bored playing it because updates come out so often  and the gym battles keep you occupied.","+","4","Awesome  I recommend it.",3512905141,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id591203381",0

"Lu adjust","This game had a rocky start. It was super popular and the servers couldn’t handle it. Now the developers push a new event almost all the time. Getting mew was fun and challenging(Ditto). Celebi and Spiritomb were arduous to obtain but Meltan has been extremely challenging because I don’t have a Nintendo switch. They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pokémon in a very creative way.  I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps.  Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn’t ruin it and trading rare Pokémon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it’s cheap.  The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn’t ever forced to buy anything and it isn’t like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live.  In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play. I can’t wait to see what they bring to the game next year.","+","5","Should be called PokemonGo 2.0",3512274607,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id9148791",3

Others live in like Texas live so far away from water.  No one willing to trade because it cost so much.

If your service isn’t strong in a lot of areas  it could be hard to play because it does require significant data. Also  for those that say they make you pay money and it’s hard to get poke balls  very often they live in a backwoods area  I have never had much of a problem with this if I go out and spin poke stops for 20 minutes.  That being said  this is a wonderful game that has gotten me and my friends out of our houses and having a good time. The continuation of updates ever improve the game  whether it’s research tasks (which totally keeps me occupied) or trading. And for those that say they can’t find Pokémon? It’s a challenge!

But I am getting frustrated lately on having to buy Poké balls to capture Pokémon and sometimes it takes so many tries! I  waste so many poke balls  I have to walk for hours to get poke balls for free or dish out the cash to purchase. I wish there were an easier option of capturing Pokémon for instance in the actual video games when battling the Pokémon with your own to weaken it first.

"isitjustified","I’ve loved all things Pokémon since season 1  episode 1 back in the 90s. I never got a chance to play the game boy renditions as we didn’t have a lot of cash.   I spent my childhood collecting cards  McDonald’s toys and backpacks/accessories. When this game came out in 2016 it reminded me how much I loved the Pokémon world.   I started collecting the game boy games and sourced a couple game boys second hand and now am continuing the series on where I left off around the third generation. If you want a trip to nostalgia then this is the world for you.   Along side the new let’s go Pikachu and let’s go eevee games this is 90s kids dreams come true.   I also love that due to this game  phones now correctly auto-correct the word Pokémon where as before it was corrected to pocket haha  Even if you don’t know anything about Pokémon at all like some of the older and younger friends I have... you’ll find some fun in this too. I highly suggest you watch the series first  at the very least watch the first season and the first movie and maybe pick up a game boy color and play through Pokémon yellow or grab a DS and play through leaf green or fire red. That will give you a better understanding of the culture that goes into this game  although not necessary. You just should.

Seriously hope Niantic does this every year cause I just started playing again in October and it was great being able to get a perfect charizard with blast burn since he’s my favorite Pokémon! However with that being said I wish there was a more reliable way to get TMs in the game. Seeing as I have a ryperior with surf... What? Yeah  anyway only way I know of is to beat raids and they don’t seem to appear that frequent in lower tiers. So just suggesting that it could be added to the shop or spinning pokestops or research rewards from pokestops. If this is already a thing my bad.

"Shadow_the_Cat","So I played Pokémon go when it first came out and it’s really improved since then. The gym system improvement on its own is amazing but the whole game has been ruined by that stupid 50 coin limit. I had four Pokémon stationed in gyms around my town and a huge valor raid knocked instinct out of dominance. I had calculated how many coins I was going to be receiving the day before  with one coin being earned every 10 minutes after the first hour and up to 50 coins per day  it was around 300. Little did I know that the 50 coin limit was on my wallet. Not the Pokémon. Niantic you’ve put us in a weird position where we WANT our gyms to be taken out. I can’t put more than one Pokémon out for fear they’ll all get knocked out on the same day.

"A raging customer","Me and my friends play this 12:00pm to 7:30pm like every day on the weekends now  it’s just so fun to compete and conquer your own city/town.  The only problem is how easy that is to do.  Gym battling is heavily  HEAVILY favored towards the attacker.  The attacker can dodge attacks  bring 6 Pokémon to the fight and try as many times as they like to defeat the gym  and they can bring their friends to help out.  The defender can only put one Pokémon(per person  that is)  which degrades in power stupidly fast (like  100-0 overnight) and you can’t even effectively repair them because you can only give so many berries at a time.  If you want to keep a Pokémon in a gym at maximum strength  you’d basically have to work/live in radius of it which is like 50 meters.  In addition  you can only get 50 pokecoins maximum each day from your gyms  total.  So it doesn’t matter how many you are defending  you will always only get 50 per day  and one 3 use incubator  for hatching Pokémon out of eggs  costs 100.  I just wish they’d make Pokémon battling like it is in the Nintendo games  where its turn based. Or atleast they could dial back the CP degradation  like  tenfold","+","4","Game is insanely fun  but could certainly improve",3487565660,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id430419652",1

The app is very fun and teaches kids good hand-eye coordination. My one concern is that if you get a really good medal  like diamond  you only have it for a week. That is one flaw that I don’t like. Maybe it automatically shows your highest medal that you’ve gotten so far. Also  when you’re on your home page  pop-ups will show. Please take my suggestions into consideration.

"Gamer.Gurl_101","Honestly I am really addicted to this game and I really love it. I just think maybe some improvements here and there could make the game better for example  maybe having custom characters that would be really cool. You can also add a feature where instead of having to use either the magnet or the jump shoes right after u get it  the game saves it in the corner of the screen and then you can click on it when u want to use it. And whenever you get mystery boxes u can chose to save them or open them and once you save about 10 boxes you can keep collecting or you can trade them in for coins maybe like 500 coins per box  or something else idk these are just ideas that I think would be cool for the game. Overall it’s an amazing game and I hope for these improvements to be added! Thx","+","4","Amazing games just some add ins :3",3482658236,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id913313231",0

So now I either have to use the old phone for my game or start all over.","+","5","Transferring",3480852558,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id943231371",0

I wish we can design our own characters and add stuff to them and make them look the way we want them to! This could also be for kids a little different. Maybe we could have a shop in the game to add stuff to our characters and change hair color  skin tone  and that kind of stuff.

"This is not a good nickname","I always had an it game angry birds Minecraft and when I was much younger Subway Surfers  I came across the game when I was only 5 or 6 when I was given my first devise from my parents for a Splendidly spent Christmas. It was a new  cheap  dark  Samsung Tablet. It was cheap  but very easy to use. I remember purchasing many apps  one of which a newly upgraded game called “Subway Surf” at least that’s what I thought it was dubbed until my mother corrected me weeks after. Once my mother told me the what I thought was a complicated game actually went around as “Subway surfers” I found this a tongue twister. “Subway suwfers” I would incorrectly call it.  4 YEARS PASSED I had lost my iPod. My sister newly had a phone and both tablets were cracked and outdated. I was in a new house and my room was what I would have thought was a mansion when I lived in my old tiny apartment home. I picked up my sisters iPod. It had not been used for years. I pressed in my sisters passcode and saw the app subway surfers  And that lead to me playing to this day!","+","4","A new start to an old game",3486945827,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id597293413",0

So then one comes at me on the track I am running on and another on the middle track and I am on the left track. So I have no where to go and I die. That’s very unfair and then you expect me to pay a precious key to survive and be put in the exact same situation?!? I can’t even....😤. Also you only get a box once in a while and then you expect me to collect like 17 of the same thing?!? I cannot keep playing with the game like this..

"Gamer.Gurl_101","Honestly I am really addicted to this game and I really love it. I just think maybe some improvements here and there could make the game better for example  maybe having custom characters that would be really cool. You can also add a feature where instead of having to use either the magnet or the jump shoes right after u get it  the game saves it in the corner of the screen and then you can click on it when u want to use it. And whenever you get mystery boxes u can chose to save them or open them and once you save about 10 boxes you can keep collecting or you can trade them in for coins maybe like 500 coins per box  or something else idk these are just ideas that I think would be cool for the game. Overall it’s an amazing game and I hope for these improvements to be added! Thx","+","4","Amazing games just some add ins :3",3482658236,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id913313231",0

"grilshuntto🦌","This game is so much fun and very addictive. I’ve had this game for about five days and I LOVE it 🥰. I play it so much that I am already 3rd place in bronze!!! There are only a few things I would suggest. First you need to remember that most of your players are young and can’t get Facebook or Snapchat I can’t get most of the skins because of that!!! Also I would love it if stuff less expensive. And I think we should get to create our own skins. But this is most likely the most fun game that I have. And it is soooooooo much better than the games you pay for.💰 all the past weekend I have been hunting and it is the only thing I have done. ✅  overall I love this game and if you are thinking about getting it you should.

Ok fine fine there is a hoverboard that is called magic carpet.And every body is gonna waste there coins it might be too easy than challenging . But....Ok ok it might need to be a little bit more easier like 800000 coins or less but for subway surfers anniversary the charecters needs too be a like 8000 coins or 10000.Also make the charecters from different maps and also for its anniversary make it the Very very first map on subway surfers but make it decorized with confettie and balloons with charecters all watching and cheering    .Last but not least story mode. When someone beats their own highscore the charecters tell them are you ready for this and your charecter says yes I am then the clap and cheer.

"I play this game and love it","This is a super fun  fast  action game. I very much would suggest for you to buy this. It is free  but when you get into the app  all of the characters are VERY expensive. It would take an extremely long time to get 980 000 coins  for one character. Although not all of the characters are that expensive  still  it makes you want to give up because it would have to take a year to get all of the coins that it is asking for. I also don’t like how you have to collect  like one character  UFO’s for her. Not coins. You collect 1 UFO at a time and are trying to get 500 UFO’s to unlock the character. That’s crazy. There is also a lot of ads  and that is very annoying. After almost every play  an ad pops up.

"BLITZ THE CLASHER","Great game very great energy as long as you join the right clan the concept isn’t at all unique but the twist to the concept of a strategic base building game done by supercell make it unique within itself and that aspect draws my attention although the game is very fun and challenging in many forms it’s still proposes as a very time consuming game it is almost as if it too strongly encourages the spending factor to create in a sense a pay to win type of game but even then the ranking system makes for a good balance to counteract that point of focus I do in fact wish times for upgrades were shortened but it would not make the game a strive for success as much as it does the way it is approached now but overall this game is fun  delightful to play with friends  very very strategic  and also easy to use and I enjoy the gameplay despite the flaws but you know what good game doesn’t have its kinks to work out and supercell does a great job of listening and working on all problems to further increase the gameplay in itself!😇","+","5","Great game!

Your choice.  1-Add a shield you can build  people who raid you with spells and nothing else and still get you half way is very irritating and embarrassing. So they have to send troops and destroy it before they can use spells like lightning  or jump. Spells like rage or freeze are okay  they are a bit op 3+  but they aren’t literally game-breaking.  And that’s it. In all honesty  People would exploit this. But make easily destroyable  that might be a good alternate  or spells can break the shield.

I was expecting to upgrade my ship and loot other ships/bases like a pirate which I thought was such an amazing idea but than the update came out and we got night more which was such a disappointment compared to the ship/pirate fantasy I had for the game.

"00_G","I’ve been playing clash of clans for about a year now and at TH8 I can say that TH7 was probably more fun to use  but new strategies allow almost new gameplay at the next level town hall  which is a fantastic concept. The night village probably could have been good but it’s kind of annoying  though that’s ok if you just focus on the main base. The reason I say it’s annoying is because of mismatches and difficulty at lower level builder halls to make progress if you don’t play too much. If the night village were the whole game I would give 2 stars. This game includes some nice concepts such as clan castle troops and troops that can jump over walls  and spells are nice too. The graphics are really well made I think  since the game is supposed to be violent but the cartoonish graphics make it more fun and light hearted. Overall  fantastic concepts  and well executed.   Negatives: It costs 500 gems to change your username. Idc if you copy minecraft or something but like  come on Build times may be too much for some. At certain points elixir/gold gets very unbalanced because of armies With clan wars  it’s almost impossible to ever get dark elixir since a hog army costs 1.5-2.5k DE at TH8. Unless you have a lot of time then there won’t be much profit if you have 1-2 clan wars a week  Otherwise  GJ","+","4","Great game  some problems",3517567123,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id145821681",0

Kind of like the Valkyrie just A guy. Next I think a knight  a person on a horse like the knight  on clash royal I think is should take normal elixir. and finally  a wolf  kind of like a werewolf  dark and powerful. it should take dark elixir.

"Satisfied casual user","This is a game you can play both casually and competitively which is great. The community aspects that being in a clan  offer are great if you and friends are looking for an app to play together. The strategy elements bring back fond memories of this base building army training genre and have enough depth to let you experiment and enjoy yourself  yet not so much that you cant just train whatever and throw it at a base when you don't feel like going all in lol  This is one of the survivors from generation to generation of iPhone updates for a reason. Its a classic  and if you play games in your free time  enjoy strategic gameplay  or need a game to play with your friends  this app should be installed on your phone.  Another thing id like to say is that people who salt over the night village are off track.  Its more competitive in my opinion - so while i recommend trying to use it  if you don't want to play competitively then don't feel pressured to go to that island.   This island does struggle from an artificially slow progression system and honestly idk how to fix that. Only being able to (for free) collect a certain amount of loot from battles a day makes it very hard to feel like your making progress. Id love to see you get *something* out of fighting more than the three battles for daily bonuses. Flaws aside the new buildings  training mechanics  troops  and battle style (of real time vs battles) are awesome and breath strategic life into the game. It provides a platform to improve your attack strategies in. You can rush your base as long as your a god at attacking - it makes the gap between free to play players and maxed bases less impactful because a good attack wins can win you the game against better defenses  and you cant buy skilled attacking  its something you practice.","+","5","You should download it",3515852620,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id316423782",0

"J. Eller","I've played the game for over 5 yrs. On the surface  Clash of Clans in an excellent mobile game that I would recommend to any casual gamer who is excited to drop their first wizard tower  hero  and/or inferno tower on the map! Where this game falls grossly short is in its customer service and pay-to-win/progress development cycle for the experienced player base. There is a rich history of dishonest press releases and customer support emails filled with friendly language offering no help to the customer (unless that customer is having trouble spending their money on Clash of Clans content). These issues easily reduce what would be a 5-star game to the 3-star rating provided. If you are competetive or a completionist  avoid this game as it is designed to extract large amounts of money from these players and the return on investment is not even close to what other titles offer for your time and finicial investment.","-","3","Solid game  poor customer support  dishonest developer",3515720887,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id116107302",0

The builder base is a little better but still takes awhile to upgrade. This is why I think there should be another base. Mabye the troops find a flying machine like they found the boat. After building the flying machine a troop is sent out to search foe something new. He ends up coming across another island and another troop from a friends village and they start a whole new base there. So you and friend can both bring resourses to the base and help build it.

I too spent quite a bit but haven't in 5 years and won't ever again.  The game now is just too gimmicky and convoluted for its own good.  The appeal for me once upon a time was the game mimicked real life where if you worked hard and saved you could build a strong defense and that was enough but now this everyone gets a trophy at the expense of the more powerful attitude has destroyed that. What's the point of saving up or buying strong walls if someone with a level one potion just jumps right over them or knocks them down?","-","1","Once upon a time it was fun...",3516166804,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id307815990",0
"Lmr1919","Clash of Clans is a great game that sparked a new mobile genre. It is also very fun to build your village and watch it expand and grow and it is very satisfying to finally hit upgrade and reach that next level.  The most enjoyable part as most all can agree is the raiding and being able to watch your enemies village get destroyed and be rewarded with all the gold and elixir. But there is one issue  you have to grind for a long time with no way to speed up the process unless you want to pay to by resources so you don’t have to wait for your collectors. Or maybe even just skip the whole process by buying gems. Besides that fact it is a amazing game if your bored or just need a pass time. Because of all these facts I give it a 4/5.","+","4","Great pass time game",3516103321,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id659850783",0

Kind of like the Valkyrie just A guy. Next I think a knight  a person on a horse like the knight  on clash royal I think is should take normal elixir. and finally  a wolf  kind of like a werewolf  dark and powerful. it should take dark elixir.

For instance  let’s say if we’re offline and someone is attacking our village. I feel like if I catch the attack live that i should be able to use my hero’s special abilities even while the person is attacking. They are just sitting ducks at that point.  Also  I see that the training time for most troops and spells have gone down a bit. But why are the upgrade cost still soo high and they take soo long to finish upgrading. I mean 1 million gold or elixir PER wall is kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Times that by however many walls your village has and it’s well over 100 million gold or elixir.  Or when you upgrade a inferno tower or even troops can take upwards to 8-10 days!?? I could travel the world and back in less days.  Overall I like the game but don’t love it.

But the support from Supercell is perhaps the worst I have ever seen from any large app or gaming company. Yes  they will respond quickly... but they respond with worthless dribble. They knowingly allow people to cheat or abuse holes in the system that creates unfair gameplay which is also not fun. The don’t allow for the dynamic changes that can happen over years of play  such as allowing clan name changes or helping restore a clan when the only leader of the clan disappears permanently leaving all the other active players hanging in the lurch. Could they fix these things? Yes. But they chose not to & instead only focus on ways to make more money for their bottom line.

"Satisfied casual user","This is a game you can play both casually and competitively which is great. The community aspects that being in a clan  offer are great if you and friends are looking for an app to play together. The strategy elements bring back fond memories of this base building army training genre and have enough depth to let you experiment and enjoy yourself  yet not so much that you cant just train whatever and throw it at a base when you don't feel like going all in lol  This is one of the survivors from generation to generation of iPhone updates for a reason. Its a classic  and if you play games in your free time  enjoy strategic gameplay  or need a game to play with your friends  this app should be installed on your phone.  Another thing id like to say is that people who salt over the night village are off track.  Its more competitive in my opinion - so while i recommend trying to use it  if you don't want to play competitively then don't feel pressured to go to that island.   This island does struggle from an artificially slow progression system and honestly idk how to fix that. Only being able to (for free) collect a certain amount of loot from battles a day makes it very hard to feel like your making progress. Id love to see you get *something* out of fighting more than the three battles for daily bonuses. Flaws aside the new buildings  training mechanics  troops  and battle style (of real time vs battles) are awesome and breath strategic life into the game. It provides a platform to improve your attack strategies in. You can rush your base as long as your a god at attacking - it makes the gap between free to play players and maxed bases less impactful because a good attack wins can win you the game against better defenses  and you cant buy skilled attacking  its something you practice.","+","5","You should download it",3515852620,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id316423782",0

I understand that you want us to work for it but if I’m going to spend time out of my day or life let’s make it a little easier to upgrade troops buildings and of course the home base. I know what your thoughts are  well the app is free  right! It is free but I would be willing to pay for a new and updated or upgraded version  let’s say $20 and everything takes less time costs less to build and or upgrade because I’ve paid for the game already.

"J. Eller","I've played the game for over 5 yrs. On the surface  Clash of Clans in an excellent mobile game that I would recommend to any casual gamer who is excited to drop their first wizard tower  hero  and/or inferno tower on the map! Where this game falls grossly short is in its customer service and pay-to-win/progress development cycle for the experienced player base. There is a rich history of dishonest press releases and customer support emails filled with friendly language offering no help to the customer (unless that customer is having trouble spending their money on Clash of Clans content). These issues easily reduce what would be a 5-star game to the 3-star rating provided. If you are competetive or a completionist  avoid this game as it is designed to extract large amounts of money from these players and the return on investment is not even close to what other titles offer for your time and finicial investment.","-","3","Solid game  poor customer support  dishonest developer",3515720887,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id116107302",0

The builder base is a little better but still takes awhile to upgrade. This is why I think there should be another base. Mabye the troops find a flying machine like they found the boat. After building the flying machine a troop is sent out to search foe something new. He ends up coming across another island and another troop from a friends village and they start a whole new base there. So you and friend can both bring resourses to the base and help build it.

"SwedishPlumber","I’ve been playing this game for about 5 years  majority of the time I’ve been in the same clan which was like a family. Our co has been inactive for quite some time and more than half of our clan is full of inactive co because some guy joined and got co somehow and invited/promoted anyone and everyone. Long story short everyone who was once a family and left and gone there separate ways because super cell REFUSES to give someone else leader ship due to the fact that there are still co leaders in the clan who lime I said before are inactive. Even if we were a full clan we would only be able to do 15-15 wars due to the fact of inactivity. I have tried to message supercell a few times about this because I am the oldest member of the clan and would like all of our hard work to be for not. They will not help and I have had a few of the customer service representatives close the conversation before I even have a chance to talk to them about concerns and needs. All in all this isn't a bad game but you can tell the people who run it only care about you spending money on their game. You would be better off investing your time on literally any other game because in the end  whatever you’ve put into it  SuperCell doesn’t care.","-","1","Longevity means nothing to supercell",3510474380,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id934577870",0

"Builders glory","I love this game  it's my favorite game of all time  I love almost everything on this game  and one of my favorite is donating  but in donating you either spend a lot of gems or mess up your troop training. I always use quick train  and if I donate troops from my camps  it messes up my whole entire quick train  and I don't want to spend all my gems just to give someone a couple troops. I think there needs to be a separate army camp that has a barracks attached to it  and you can train troops to fill that army camp  you also can't use the troops from that army camp to attack  you can only use those troops to donate  the barracks attached to the camp is always at the same level as your highest leveled barracks you have  please take my suggestions into mind and try to work on this in the next update.","+","5","Amazing game but donating needs improved",3445661087,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id694071481",0

I’ve experienced no glitches and the graphics are amazing. I would play this game if you are an organizing person and are good at strategy games. There are plenty of good things about this game: 1. Graphics  2. Balance  3. FREE  4. Plenty of levels and good use of time  5. 2 different villages  6. Lots of troops and buildings  and 7. Heroes. And if you’re not patient  get clash royale!

Unless the program only deals winnable solutions.

"PhilNewby","This Solitaire game has been around since my very first iPhone. MobilityWare has been in this realm a long time  so their apps are very very good. Gameplay is smooth and has many customizable settings and options.  My only complaint (albeit a small one) is the way these ad-supported games work. They just blast you with ads. Game completion  game restart  new game  etc....all trigger ads. I understand the model they have to work from to generate revenue  but it seems like there could be fewer and still show the appropriate number of ads to generate income from users. The problem is with so many options to pick from  and Solitaire being a game that's identical from one developer to another  is that the next game that has less or no ads will be the one people move to. That said  hopefully MW can tone it down some and make the overall gameplay experience less interrupted and distracting  ....it's an otherwise great execution to a fun game.","+","4","Good - just expect a lot of ads",3466229036,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id139613627",0

"Tag:(","I expect occasional ads with any free game  (that is after all  the price of admission.) However  long pop-up ads before EVERY SINGLE GAME are a nuisance. Many have such a small "x" that you have to tap it many times to close the ad. The X is intentionally placed close to the link to open the advertisers link.   The game is good  but would be better with less abusive tactics.  Why do I use the strong word "abusive"? Well  closing one ad and it immediately re-opening isn't changing my mind about downloading it.  Also  If I closed your pop up ad for the last game a few seconds ago  do you think I will change my mind if you harass me? I will NEVER download a nag ad! Stop harassing me. UPDATE: OK  your response to my legitimate complaint was illegitimate: You believe that pop ups before every game is OK because you don't interrupt the MIDDLE of a game?

The ones that just move the same figure around the screen or just flip their cards are very boring.   However  with the new update  the controls on the bottom of the screen are WAY too large. They are very distracting and often cover the bottom cards of a long column. Not only does this make the cards difficult to see but also causes problems trying to tap them without activating the controls. I also like to be able to see the game clock and the number of moves on the same screen as in the past.

It was sooo much more satisfying to unlock a new blade/dojo by getting 3 combos in a row or slicing 200 pineapples. Now it’s just  “here  save up and buy this...”and I can deal with that  I admit. But it’s the constant crashing of the game that drives me bonkers!!! I’ll be in the middle of a game  or just ending it and BAM. Crash. And everything I just did is lost. It’s ridiculous.

Tbh it’s my favorite background and it’s really disappointing when you buy power ups and your blade and background don’t work. A waste is what I call it.

We got a few games  one of them being Fruit Ninja-it was an amazing game  we all loved it. Updates came  it was still great. New iPad  still fun. On my birthday I got my own iPad and just recently I remembered Fruit Ninja! I got it  I was super excited-THEN the whole temple thing came. I was still fine with it-until I had to slice the fruit a totally new way! Don’t get me wrong the 1  2  3  point Stuff is good  you can challenge how quick your brain is-BUT the instructions are horrible. It never ONCE tells you about the point stuff so I kept losing and had no idea why! I kept re-reading and reading and it made no sense.

Now I see that there are crappy pay to win items like some golden blade you freeze fruit and get double points? Why? So to beat certain scores you’re asked to pay 10$... well game is ruined from its original. Not to mention I had most of the older blades unlocked along with most backgrounds. Again... pay to win with your bonus powers. (Thanks for the info  the game is nice but an ad at every turn along with pay2win mechanics still takes a game from a 5 star to at best a two star.

They’ve taken it to a whole new level.  Keep in mind I purchased this game when it first came out and wasn’t free. Now they’ve added advertisements in between games. Really? Also  there’s a new update to their privacy policy that lets them collect and sell your information. This is NOT okay.  This game is trash now and I feel abused as a paying customer.

And then I got to level 15 one popped up  I thought I accidentally clicked one  so I didn’t think anything of it  but it happened again and again and again. Super frustrating. Plus  I don’t even get anything out of watching those forced ads. I say it’s not fair to the players who don’t want the extra stuff from the game.

"FrootNinja","Overall this is a fun game. I like the powers of the blades and the different dojos. However  while I have only one gripe with this game  it is a pretty major one. When using any blade other than the original blade (the one you start off with)  the blade animations begin to gradually appear on the screen as you play the round. For example if I were using the pixel blade  more and more pixels would appear on my screen. And once the round ends  when you’ve hit a bomb or dropped too many fruit or whatever  the animations don’t go away. They’re there for every single game you play after that  and the only way I’ve found to get rid of them is by closing the window. The animations block your view of the fruit and make it really hard to avoid hitting bombs. Why is this feature there? Is it a glitch? I find this annoying and unnecessary and I hope it is removed as soon as possible.","-","3","Can’t see the fruit.",2688007637,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141333847",7

"Delta VEEEEEEEEEEE","Hello. First of all  this is a great game  and the game is not as bad as what other people say about the game  however  nothing is perfect  and here are a few flaws I experience while playing this game. You need to make the fruits more visible. I normally randomly get a strike when It looks like I cut every fruit. Also  a problem that may lead to that is that sometimes when I cut a fruit the blade goes through it without being cut. It’s really hard to react and cut it again after that  which is annoying. Besides some flaws  this game is very addicting  and the developers shouldn’t be yelled at because of a few mistakes.","+","4","It’s ok.",2243204983,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id567537969",21

"Delta VEEEEEEEEEEE","Hello. First of all  this is a great game  and the game is not as bad as what other people say about the game  however  nothing is perfect  and here are a few flaws I experience while playing this game. You need to make the fruits more visible. I normally randomly get a strike when It looks like I cut every fruit. Also  a problem that may lead to that is that sometimes when I cut a fruit the blade goes through it without being cut. It’s really hard to react and cut it again after that  which is annoying. Besides some flaws  this game is very addicting  and the developers shouldn’t be yelled at because of a few mistakes.","+","4","It’s ok.",2243204983,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id567537969",21

With this last update  they are COMPLETELY capitalizing on the Ghostbusters release. Minicamps are now 300 Starfruit and it's extremely hard to get Golden Apples without purchasing them on the store. On top of that  any prize you want out of the Ghostbusters game would require you to play the game about 500+ times. Total Crap!

However  my main complaint is actually personal. I was playing around the time of the Golden Ember Blade and actually managed to win it. Seeing as it is now $15  you can imagine how mad I was that it disappeared when I deleted the app  as did all my progress. And yes  I’ve tried logging back in to the Gamecenter and the Halfbrick account connected to it.   TL;DR: used to be good  then microtransactions and failure to save data ruined it for me.","-","2","Same complaint as most...",1917942127,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id362726562",2

"newfastautomattik","Fruit Ninja is still a really solid game  but boy has it changed. I remember playing it when it was first released years ago. Now it is almost unrecognizable because of the sheer amount of micro-transaction convoluted bull****  for lack of a better phrase. Why do so many games continue to try and force-feed micro-transactions to players? The menu layout is also way too much and way too complex for a game this simple  and it’s all because of micro-transactions pushing. Some people are okay with this  and if you are one of them then you would really like Fruit Ninja.

"Tedi138","The basic modes (classic  arcade  and zen) are really fun the the update has some issues  especially with the mini games. The mini games are WAY too expensive and you don't get many golden apples from them. And the app keeps crashing. One time I spent 300 star fruit on a mini game and it crashed and didn't give me my starfruit nor any golden apples. If I knew that would have happened I wouldn't have spent my starfruit. As with the tournament  it's nearly impossible to win because when you mix the two different colors of fruit and a bunch of bombs  you can't get any points because you'll hit the opponent's fruits which will give THEM points or you'll hit a bomb which makes you lose even more. But it you just leave the fruit to fall you'll most likely lose the game. And that makes it really frustrating because the computer can easily be programmed to swipe only the red fruit and nothing else.  The newest Halloween update is great but in the free dojo it's nearly impossible to get any candy and in the other ones you have to pay golden apples  which is an issue because of the mini games.   I know this review turned out to be really long but these problems are really frustrating. If they were fixed overall it would be a great game!","-","2","Issues",1469581390,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id461942633",1
