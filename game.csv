"Reedüçä","Update: I‚Äôm now on level 171. It requires me to get 10 striped candies in 12 moves. That‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôve been on this level for days and I‚Äôve wasted boosters. I don‚Äôt see any way I‚Äôm ever going to pass this level unless I get incredibly lucky with the board. Please add more moves. The levels should be challenging  but they shouldn‚Äôt be near impossible.  -  It‚Äôs a fun game and a good way to pass time on the subway or waiting for an appointment. Overall I like it  I just have two suggestions: 1. Add an option to turn off hints. Most of the time they‚Äôre not actually helpful  but just a distraction. For example  every time there‚Äôs a color bomb on the board the game wants me to use it. Often times I‚Äôm saving the bomb for a later move but the game won‚Äôt stop telling me to use it now. 2. Add a confirmation for buying things with gold bars. Earlier today I failed a level and I accidentally pressed the button to pay for more moves. I wasted 10 bars. Just a simple ‚ÄúThis will cost 10 bars. Continue?‚Äù with a yes button and a cancel button would be helpful.","-","2","Changed to 2 stars",3535516438,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id947747941",1.140.0,0

I have already bought three banks in one day and now they want me to buy a forth bank so I can get my hard earned gold. As long as I don‚Äôt buy the bank  they throw my extra gold away. Not cool. Sad day when you earn something but you don‚Äôt have access to it unless you pay a ransom ‚Äúreal‚Äù cash money to get it out of hock.

"CatPenguin291","I love Candy Crush who doesn‚Äôt. But the game should be less addictive as it is. I played about 20 levels this morning and they were not easy. What I don‚Äôt like is that they only sometimes gives you boosts and such when you don‚Äôt to bribe you into the game. Something positive I should say is I love how the game is basically telling a story in candy land. The main character Tiff helps animals. I like that the challenges get harder as you go but not too hard that is good so you adapt and don‚Äôt notice how much harder they are compared from 80 to 1. And I like the contests because it‚Äôs fun to compete with people even if you don‚Äôt know them. I am really competitive so of course I do. I hate how they advertise other games by the company in the game because for their own sake people are going to stop playing cause of these adds. The gold bars are great when you have them but unfortunately they go away or spent very quickly that is.

I think adding the switch would be an amazing way to get some of those lower level Pok√©mon way up there in cp. but maybe they‚Äôve anticipated that and think it could wreck the game in some way.

"CassandraIA","My kids and I started playing in Feb 2017 and we loved playing this game together. We love traveling and collecting Pok√©mon when we travel. Earlier this year many features have been introduced that we were very excited about but as they have been introduced they exclude kids from being able to use these features. We were very excited when traiding was going to be available yet my kids accounts are blocked from having friends or traiding. Every other thing introduced is also blocked from my kids accounts like friends  trading  alolan Pok√©mon and 7 km eggs  lucky Pok√©mon and even the new player vs player feature. Why would Niantic and The Pokemon Company exclude kids from playing a game that kids helped build the Pok√©mon empire???  I hope they wake up and fix this soon. So disappointed with this. Parents don‚Äôt spend money on this as your kids will only be disappointed.","-","1","Niantic excludes kids from playing this game",3525845558,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17453113",1.99.1,0

"ImbuedPhoenix45","Love this game! Been playing it since launch  and it gets better and better over time. This is game is simply  amazing without a doubt. However  I believe it can get even better! To improve upon this already great game  here are a few new features I believe many fans would appreciate being added to the game as an potential update sometime in the near future:  1. More choices for avatar customization - More hair styles and colors  - More skin tones - more facial features    a. character/trademark masks/costumes/etc.   b. more sizes/shapes/styles of noses  eyes  mouths  chin  ears  etc.   c. more body types     > heavy     > athletic      > skinny     > average      > other   d. ability to change your avatar‚Äôs height     > The ability to change your avatar‚Äôs battle team (maybe only once every 3 months or so) - Valor to Mystic/Instinct - Mystic to Valor/Instinct  - Instinct to Valor/Mystic 3. Ability to request/vote for the addition of new pok√©-stop and gym locations (most certainly in states/regions/cities/townships/rural areas where there really aren‚Äôt many pok√©-stop locations or gyms within walking distance of local residents) 4. Allowing players to view areas very far away from their current location  - ability to scroll and zoom in/out to view pok√©-stops and gyms in other states  providences  cities  and countries around the world   a. when viewing gyms outside a 2 mile radius of your current location:     > allow players the ability to view the Pok√©mon and their respective CP levels  current raid bosses/live timers  and the team who is currently in control of that gym     > allow players to send berries to to a damaged Pok√©mon from far away (maybe only one or a maximum of one berry/per day is allowed to be sent to a trainer‚Äôs Pok√©mon from far away similar to how special trades are allowed only once per day) 5. Ability to skip dialogue during research tasks 6. Ability to skip animations such as evolution animations  hatching egg animations  leveling up animations  and trading animations  etc.  7. Ability to chat      > w/ friends     > w/ other players during raid battles      > with a code for a online chatroom 8. etc.   These are a few features I‚Äôd like to see being added to the game and I can confirm that I‚Äôm not really the only person who wants these features to be added. There are many fans out there who are probably in agreement with me that many of the aforementioned features should be added to the game to make it more enjoyable than it is now.   Just a few suggestions to consider. No big deal if they aren‚Äôt added to the game  but it would be a bummer if they weren‚Äôt because many of my friends have told me they would very much like these suggestions to be considered and added as soon as possible. Nevertheless  still a fantastic game and I will continue to play it regardless of whether or not any more changes are made to the game. Lastly  I thank you for your time  and have a great rest of your day/night! Gotta catch ‚Äòem all!","+","5","Suggestions",3521790338,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id571634268",1.99.1,0

They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pok√©mon in a very creative way.  I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps.  Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn‚Äôt ruin it and trading rare Pok√©mon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it‚Äôs cheap.  The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn‚Äôt ever forced to buy anything and it isn‚Äôt like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live.  In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play.

If your service isn‚Äôt strong in a lot of areas  it could be hard to play because it does require significant data. Also  for those that say they make you pay money and it‚Äôs hard to get poke balls  very often they live in a backwoods area  I have never had much of a problem with this if I go out and spin poke stops for 20 minutes.  That being said  this is a wonderful game that has gotten me and my friends out of our houses and having a good time. The continuation of updates ever improve the game  whether it‚Äôs research tasks (which totally keeps me occupied) or trading. And for those that say they can‚Äôt find Pok√©mon? It‚Äôs a challenge!

Such as a certain number of pokeballs for each mile (pain my 'Americaness') you walk away from your home  or even a progressive number of miles with a bigger rewards the farther away you get.

Getting mew was fun and challenging(Ditto). Celebi and Spiritomb were arduous to obtain but Meltan has been extremely challenging because I don‚Äôt have a Nintendo switch. They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pok√©mon in a very creative way.  I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps.  Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn‚Äôt ruin it and trading rare Pok√©mon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it‚Äôs cheap.  The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn‚Äôt ever forced to buy anything and it isn‚Äôt like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live.  In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play. I can‚Äôt wait to see what they bring to the game next year.","+","5","Should be called PokemonGo 2.0",3512274607,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id9148791",1.97.2,3

"A Mercer Review","All these reviews are very often problems with people‚Äôs phones being old and they don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I have hardly had any of these problems playing with an iPhone 6s. If your service isn‚Äôt strong in a lot of areas  it could be hard to play because it does require significant data. Also  for those that say they make you pay money and it‚Äôs hard to get poke balls  very often they live in a backwoods area  I have never had much of a problem with this if I go out and spin poke stops for 20 minutes.  That being said  this is a wonderful game that has gotten me and my friends out of our houses and having a good time. The continuation of updates ever improve the game  whether it‚Äôs research tasks (which totally keeps me occupied) or trading. And for those that say they can‚Äôt find Pok√©mon? It‚Äôs a challenge! And that makes it really fun. Can‚Äôt wait for more to come!","+","5","Reading Reviews and Scared? Read this:",3509331124,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id834520523",1.97.2,1

I hit x30 Mission sets and for some reason  it stopped at x30 but the sets keep rising on my mission panel every time I go to take a mission  currently am at x34 but I don‚Äôt get that when surfing. At least give some special treat to users with 1M  either by offering them a an entirely free new character or some options for them to chose upon. Everything in the shop is just too expensive and the character tokens deserve at least x5 when you acquire them in the mystery boxes due to their large numbers.

"This is not a good nickname","I always had an it game angry birds Minecraft and when I was much younger Subway Surfers  I came across the game when I was only 5 or 6 when I was given my first devise from my parents for a Splendidly spent Christmas. It was a new  cheap  dark  Samsung Tablet. It was cheap  but very easy to use. I remember purchasing many apps  one of which a newly upgraded game called ‚ÄúSubway Surf‚Äù at least that‚Äôs what I thought it was dubbed until my mother corrected me weeks after. Once my mother told me the what I thought was a complicated game actually went around as ‚ÄúSubway surfers‚Äù I found this a tongue twister. ‚ÄúSubway suwfers‚Äù I would incorrectly call it.  4 YEARS PASSED I had lost my iPod. My sister newly had a phone and both tablets were cracked and outdated. I was in a new house and my room was what I would have thought was a mansion when I lived in my old tiny apartment home. I picked up my sisters iPod. It had not been used for years. I pressed in my sisters passcode and saw the app subway surfers  And that lead to me playing to this day!","+","4","A new start to an old game",3486945827,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id597293413",1.96.0,0

"Gamer.Gurl_101","Honestly I am really addicted to this game and I really love it. I just think maybe some improvements here and there could make the game better for example  maybe having custom characters that would be really cool. You can also add a feature where instead of having to use either the magnet or the jump shoes right after u get it  the game saves it in the corner of the screen and then you can click on it when u want to use it. And whenever you get mystery boxes u can chose to save them or open them and once you save about 10 boxes you can keep collecting or you can trade them in for coins maybe like 500 coins per box  or something else idk these are just ideas that I think would be cool for the game. Overall it‚Äôs an amazing game and I hope for these improvements to be added! Thx","+","4","Amazing games just some add ins :3",3482658236,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id913313231",1.96.0,0

"Sameeteeraak","I‚Äôve been an avid Subway Surfers aficionado for over five years and really disfavor the shorthand scoring tallies that this new version has created. Please let us see our true  full numerical totals again. At least somewhere in the game‚Äôs screens.   Sometimes  in a compulsion to seek change  you can forget the old adage that ‚Äòperfect is the enemy of good enough‚Äô.  We really have no need to see all of our scoring results on one screen  especially if they are truncated. I‚Äôve worked hard to amass my various totals...most particularly my coin total...and now have no idea of my actual results as you have blocked them from view. If I want to purchase more coins or keys  it motivates me far more to do so if I can see the full amounts in my account.   Perhaps if you insist on truncating these scores on the main page  could you still show the fully expanded totals elsewhere in the game?  Thank you for reading this review.

All you do is play once and your a pro. If you like fortnite this is the game for you except better! You get easy skins easy coins and keys and hover boards and prizes.

Your choice.  1-Add a shield you can build  people who raid you with spells and nothing else and still get you half way is very irritating and embarrassing.

And that‚Äôs it. In all honesty  People would exploit this. But make easily destroyable  that might be a good alternate  or spells can break the shield.

I too spent quite a bit but haven't in 5 years and won't ever again.  The game now is just too gimmicky and convoluted for its own good.  The appeal for me once upon a time was the game mimicked real life where if you worked hard and saved you could build a strong defense and that was enough but now this everyone gets a trophy at the expense of the more powerful attitude has destroyed that.

"AceVang","I have been playing this game for a while. I‚Äôm a max th10. Don‚Äôt really want to go to th11. But I feel like there could be some more features and updates to the game. For instance  let‚Äôs say if we‚Äôre offline and someone is attacking our village. I feel like if I catch the attack live that i should be able to use my hero‚Äôs special abilities even while the person is attacking. They are just sitting ducks at that point.  Also  I see that the training time for most troops and spells have gone down a bit. But why are the upgrade cost still soo high and they take soo long to finish upgrading. I mean 1 million gold or elixir PER wall is kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Times that by however many walls your village has and it‚Äôs well over 100 million gold or elixir.  Or when you upgrade a inferno tower or even troops can take upwards to 8-10 days!?? I could travel the world and back in less days.  Overall I like the game but don‚Äôt love it. Maybe a few changes and updates will change my mind.","+","4","Like it but don‚Äôt love it.",3515925253,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id130523312",11.185.4,0

"carlcaudle","This is a very fun game  & can be quite addictive  especially if you have an active & fun clan.    But the support from Supercell is perhaps the worst I have ever seen from any large app or gaming company. Yes  they will respond quickly... but they respond with worthless dribble. They knowingly allow people to cheat or abuse holes in the system that creates unfair gameplay which is also not fun. The don‚Äôt allow for the dynamic changes that can happen over years of play  such as allowing clan name changes or helping restore a clan when the only leader of the clan disappears permanently leaving all the other active players hanging in the lurch. Could they fix these things? Yes. But they chose not to & instead only focus on ways to make more money for their bottom line. Ironically  they would get a lot more of my money like they did in the early days if they would step up & be more helpful.","-","2","Great game  decent app  awful support.",3515922931,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41556578",11.185.4,0

"Satisfied casual user","This is a game you can play both casually and competitively which is great. The community aspects that being in a clan  offer are great if you and friends are looking for an app to play together. The strategy elements bring back fond memories of this base building army training genre and have enough depth to let you experiment and enjoy yourself  yet not so much that you cant just train whatever and throw it at a base when you don't feel like going all in lol  This is one of the survivors from generation to generation of iPhone updates for a reason. Its a classic  and if you play games in your free time  enjoy strategic gameplay  or need a game to play with your friends  this app should be installed on your phone.  Another thing id like to say is that people who salt over the night village are off track.  Its more competitive in my opinion - so while i recommend trying to use it  if you don't want to play competitively then don't feel pressured to go to that island.   This island does struggle from an artificially slow progression system and honestly idk how to fix that. Only being able to (for free) collect a certain amount of loot from battles a day makes it very hard to feel like your making progress. Id love to see you get *something* out of fighting more than the three battles for daily bonuses. Flaws aside the new buildings  training mechanics  troops  and battle style (of real time vs battles) are awesome and breath strategic life into the game. It provides a platform to improve your attack strategies in. You can rush your base as long as your a god at attacking - it makes the gap between free to play players and maxed bases less impactful because a good attack wins can win you the game against better defenses  and you cant buy skilled attacking  its something you practice.","+","5","You should download it",3515852620,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id316423782",11.185.4,0

I understand that you want us to work for it but if I‚Äôm going to spend time out of my day or life let‚Äôs make it a little easier to upgrade troops buildings and of course the home base. I know what your thoughts are  well the app is free  right! It is free but I would be willing to pay for a new and updated or upgraded version  let‚Äôs say $20 and everything takes less time costs less to build and or upgrade because I‚Äôve paid for the game already.

"J. Eller","I've played the game for over 5 yrs. On the surface  Clash of Clans in an excellent mobile game that I would recommend to any casual gamer who is excited to drop their first wizard tower  hero  and/or inferno tower on the map! Where this game falls grossly short is in its customer service and pay-to-win/progress development cycle for the experienced player base. There is a rich history of dishonest press releases and customer support emails filled with friendly language offering no help to the customer (unless that customer is having trouble spending their money on Clash of Clans content). These issues easily reduce what would be a 5-star game to the 3-star rating provided. If you are competetive or a completionist  avoid this game as it is designed to extract large amounts of money from these players and the return on investment is not even close to what other titles offer for your time and finicial investment.","-","3","Solid game  poor customer support  dishonest developer",3515720887,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id116107302",11.185.4,0

"Cgodd10","I really like this game. And being a town hall 11 the game had started to move slower and slower with some upgrades taking 8 to 14 days to finish and costing a lot of gold and elixer. The builder base is a little better but still takes awhile to upgrade. This is why I think there should be another base. Mabye the troops find a flying machine like they found the boat. After building the flying machine a troop is sent out to search foe something new. He ends up coming across another island and another troop from a friends village and they start a whole new base there. So you and friend can both bring resourses to the base and help build it. This would help keep the game a little more active and fun.","+","5","Like the game but have a improvement",3513812592,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id288606560",11.49.11,0

"SwedishPlumber","I‚Äôve been playing this game for about 5 years  majority of the time I‚Äôve been in the same clan which was like a family. Our co has been inactive for quite some time and more than half of our clan is full of inactive co because some guy joined and got co somehow and invited/promoted anyone and everyone. Long story short everyone who was once a family and left and gone there separate ways because super cell REFUSES to give someone else leader ship due to the fact that there are still co leaders in the clan who lime I said before are inactive. Even if we were a full clan we would only be able to do 15-15 wars due to the fact of inactivity. I have tried to message supercell a few times about this because I am the oldest member of the clan and would like all of our hard work to be for not. They will not help and I have had a few of the customer service representatives close the conversation before I even have a chance to talk to them about concerns and needs. All in all this isn't a bad game but you can tell the people who run it only care about you spending money on their game.

In fact once when I had scored 56 percent on the enemy and the enemy scored 50 percent on me it said DEFEAT! Not to mention I also lists my trophies. Overall the game is cool but can you please fix this because it is really irritating. If that problem is fixed I‚Äôll rate the game 5 stars. But my only concern now is I can not find any players weaker then me and it is SUPER HARD TO ATTACK!!!!!

"PhilNewby","This Solitaire game has been around since my very first iPhone. MobilityWare has been in this realm a long time  so their apps are very very good. Gameplay is smooth and has many customizable settings and options.  My only complaint (albeit a small one) is the way these ad-supported games work. They just blast you with ads. Game completion  game restart  new game  etc....all trigger ads. I understand the model they have to work from to generate revenue  but it seems like there could be fewer and still show the appropriate number of ads to generate income from users. The problem is with so many options to pick from  and Solitaire being a game that's identical from one developer to another  is that the next game that has less or no ads will be the one people move to. That said  hopefully MW can tone it down some and make the overall gameplay experience less interrupted and distracting  ....it's an otherwise great execution to a fun game.","+","4","Good - just expect a lot of ads",3466229036,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id139613627",6.0.8,0

I understand that advertising is your means of revenue generation  but forcing me to close multiple screens to play a game doesn‚Äôt make me more inclined to make a purchase ... quite the opposite. The most annoying feature of the ads is their ability to over ride the phones ‚Äúsilence‚Äù setting and still play audible background. The only way to avoid is to have volume adjusted all the way down. I often play this game when I am waiting in a public place. I have my ringer/notifications turned off for a reason.

"Tag:(","I expect occasional ads with any free game  (that is after all  the price of admission.) However  long pop-up ads before EVERY SINGLE GAME are a nuisance. Many have such a small "x" that you have to tap it many times to close the ad. The X is intentionally placed close to the link to open the advertisers link.   The game is good  but would be better with less abusive tactics.  Why do I use the strong word "abusive"? Well  closing one ad and it immediately re-opening isn't changing my mind about downloading it.

But  if you are looking at the reviews to see if you should download the game or not- strap in for a middle school sized essay. The first thing I would change about this game is the main menu and how you unlock modes. When I first started on this game  I thought that I would get every mode at the start of the game  but I had to unlock all of them  (except classic) and that led to me being extremely frustrated and took me about a month to unlock all of the modes. It explains everything in the description of the app  including how to play the modes  but failed to mention how long it takes you to unlock all of these modes. And every mode (except classic  arcade  and zen) were epic fails. When you unlock another mode  a message of ‚Äù THIS MODE IS CRAPPY  SUCKER ‚Äù should appear. The second thing I would change is  get rid of the fruit fact saying that apple seeds are poisonous. When I was little and I played this game (I was like 5) I was very close to not eating apples  but my mom told me the truth. And I think that this game appeals to younger kids  and apples might be the only healthy thing they eat. Other than that  home run!

"FrootNinja","Overall this is a fun game. I like the powers of the blades and the different dojos. However  while I have only one gripe with this game  it is a pretty major one. When using any blade other than the original blade (the one you start off with)  the blade animations begin to gradually appear on the screen as you play the round. For example if I were using the pixel blade  more and more pixels would appear on my screen. And once the round ends  when you‚Äôve hit a bomb or dropped too many fruit or whatever  the animations don‚Äôt go away. They‚Äôre there for every single game you play after that  and the only way I‚Äôve found to get rid of them is by closing the window. The animations block your view of the fruit and make it really hard to avoid hitting bombs. Why is this feature there? Is it a glitch?

I haven‚Äôt seen him play it but I saw it on his iPad once  and the logo was gold and red and on it said ‚Äú5th anniversary‚Äù. I took a look at it and I really wanted to try  out the festival event. But the day before  I had updated my fruit ninja and nothing was different. I checked the AppStore  for new updates but there wasn‚Äôt any. I‚Äôm a little confused about why he has the anniversary version and not me. Is it a old update that he still has because he hasn‚Äôt  updated again?  Thank you very much for listening.

The menu layout is also way too much and way too complex for a game this simple  and it‚Äôs all because of micro-transactions pushing.

"Tedi138","The basic modes (classic  arcade  and zen) are really fun the the update has some issues  especially with the mini games. The mini games are WAY too expensive and you don't get many golden apples from them. And the app keeps crashing. One time I spent 300 star fruit on a mini game and it crashed and didn't give me my starfruit nor any golden apples. If I knew that would have happened I wouldn't have spent my starfruit. As with the tournament  it's nearly impossible to win because when you mix the two different colors of fruit and a bunch of bombs  you can't get any points because you'll hit the opponent's fruits which will give THEM points or you'll hit a bomb which makes you lose even more. But it you just leave the fruit to fall you'll most likely lose the game. And that makes it really frustrating because the computer can easily be programmed to swipe only the red fruit and nothing else.  The newest Halloween update is great but in the free dojo it's nearly impossible to get any candy and in the other ones you have to pay golden apples  which is an issue because of the mini games.   I know this review turned out to be really long but these problems are really frustrating. If they were fixed overall it would be a great game!","-","2","Issues",1469581390,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id461942633",2.4.1,1
