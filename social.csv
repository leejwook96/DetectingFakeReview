Nothing is being done about it cause nobody cares.   Facebook  please don‚Äôt forget you can become obsolete like the app you crushed years ago. I remember a day when if something was wrong or a bug was found within the app  it was corrected as soon as it was reported or at least a solution to the issue was sent.

"Sugargirl33","Update: 12/13/18 Nothing has changed  still not seeing any posts. You‚Äôve totally ruined a good thing. I hardly use Facebook anymore because of the same issues that aren‚Äôt being fixed. I‚Äôm an admin for 2 Business Pages and have cut back on Facebook postings.   Update: 10/1/18 Even worse than before! Non stop ads  no posts showing from friends unless it‚Äôs a share from a Facebook page! Hate this app! Please at least being the feeds back where I can set up what to see - not what YOU decide to show me! Read the thousands of bad reviews all saying the same thing and do something about it!   Update: 8/10/18 Facebook is even worse now that you removed friend feeds! I‚Äôm not seeming any posts from my friends unless it‚Äôs something they shared from a Facebook page. I‚Äôm only shown 3 posts and I have close to 200 friends plus pages I like. What do you expect us to do... visit everyone‚Äôs Facebook page to see any posts? Biggest mistake you‚Äôve made. My feeds were the only way I could see posts now Facebook is unusable.   AND... I typed a name of a show I was interested in on my notes app on my iPad. The next day  I see a sponsored video for that show! You are invading our privacy!  Clearly all you care about is money and not the user. You fail to address the thousands of complaints by users.   When I hide a post or any of your unhelpful  unwanted suggestions  they just come back next time I open the app. You still continue to control what I see instead of what I want to see.  I don't see my friend's posts unless they share a page post. I want to see their written posts/photos. I tried setting up multiple feeds but Facebook continues to control what they want me to see-not what I want to see. I've missed so many important posts because Facebook doesn't show me what I want to see. If I choose to receive notifications  I still don't see the posts.  I made a post and it didn't even show in my newsfeed!   Most recent posts does not work at all. I'm shown a post from a week ago.  I don't want to see the non-stop suggested pages  groups  items for sale  friends  etc. No matter how many times I "x" them out  they just keep coming back. If I want to friend  like or follow someone  I'll find it on my own.   I get constant group suggestions and I am forced to provide feedback when I "x" them out.   Same posts and group  friend  page suggestions keep coming back even though I hide them.  Now  suggested friends to add when you visit a group page? Give us a break with the non-stop suggestions!  Today  I had 3 posts on my newsfeed from Facebook for my "February memories" - today is March 10th. Hid them because I don't care. Next few times I've gone on  there they are again!   Seems the only thing that matters to the creator of Facebook is adding to his billions of dollars instead of allowing users to connect what they want. He totally lost sight of why he created Facebook in the first place.","-","1","Awful  frustrating  controlling",3527162475,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id25096559",199.0,0

However MY Instagram doesn‚Äôt have such features. I‚Äôd recently made a second Instagram page to post my art content  and I immediately noticed that the features missing on my main account  were on my art account!!! How infuriating!!!!

I emailed them and they told me I had to verify my account  which I did  and they still did nothing. I‚Äôm not even sure why they asked me to verify my account since nothing happened. Seems like the support team is just there to waste people‚Äôs time before they get fed up with this app and delete it. It‚Äôs a shame because this actually used to be a good app. Just stay away from this app.‚Äù  I‚Äôve reviewed this app before  but this is a follow up. The part in quotes is my original review and the reason I‚Äôm following up is because the MeetMe developers told me to email them so they could help. Well I have no idea why they told me to email them because I emailed them over a month before my review and they have been no help at all. My posts still don‚Äôt show up and I‚Äôm still being harassed and stalked.   Basically you‚Äôre on your own with this app because the developers not only don‚Äôt care if their members get harassed and bullied constantly  they encourage letting people bully and harassed their members by doing nothing for the ones being bullied and harassed.","-","1","I used to enjoy MeetMe  BUT",3495965715,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id553873438",13.7.0,3

This innocent app has now become a scam. Not just an ordinary scam but a scary and uncomfortable scam that could make you feel uneasy and uncomfortable as you go on through life as it will keep you thinking in the back of your mind if you‚Äôre safe to walk outside without being watched.

I was quite happy that I paid for elite status since I thought I was going to have access to these new features. Especially since most of the people on here are a bunch of horndogs that I'd like to avoid... But it turns out that they took away my elite status and robbed me of my money!!!

The only way to share a video off of YouTube is by sending the other person a link to the video.  This application basically downgraded itself to a glorified text messaging app.  After requesting assistance from Rabbit concerning their massive loss in usability and functionality  I was directed to kindly check back later as features were constantly being added. It has been several months and the app has yet to include a fraction of what it used to be.

In addition  the app has a tendency to kick me out of rooms someone else is hosting about once every ~25 minutes  which is more annoying than anything else.

"Dylan2187_","So on my iPhone  whenever I get sent an invite link  the link takes me to Safari and sends me to the main Rabbit page instead of opening my app and taking me to the room I was invited to join. So to solve this issue  I‚Äôll send a friend request or have someone friend request me  and afterwards they‚Äôll send me an invite through the app  and I‚Äôll join.  But this new update  I‚Äôm not sure how to send friend requests or even accept any friend requests. There is an option to put in a code to join a group  but it didn‚Äôt work when I tried using the link for the group. Cause it seems the code is supposed to be part of the url link  but none of them work. I can still connect with friends I already had  but I‚Äôm not given any option to add any new friends or even receive any friend request in a notification  but I am given the option to send other people invites to sign up for Rabbit.  I‚Äôm not trying to be mean about this response  I only gave one star cause I had to give up on joining a group with my friends. Right now they‚Äôre all watching a movie I wanted to watch with them  they even paused the movie and all tried their best to help me join  but nothing seemed to work. I don‚Äôt have a lap top or computer  so mobile is my only option. All I ask is that there should be an easier option to send and receive friend requests  cause this app seems to have more issues on the iOS.

"Crazy Jacob G","Old review: Rabbit is one of the greatest ideas I've ever seen. Talk and chat with friends while watching and doing just about anything online? Yes please! It's very fun  easy to learn and use  and quite addictive--I've used it for more than a year and I'm on it most days of the week. There's not much to complain about except for random issues like YouTube videos reverting from full screen to small screen after a few seconds for no reason  or only 2 video quality options when there used to be 3  or "script has stopped running" messages  or options like passing the remote to a friend that could be simplified with extra buttons. All in all though it's a fantastic tool and I'm so glad it exists and for free. ****  New review: what the heck is with these updates? First we lose SD video quality  then controlling the video on mobile becomes insanely hard and inconvenient  and now navigating the app is more confusing than ever with much fewer options than desktop. And every time I contact the devs to bring up my frustrations they do absolutely nothing about it! Rabbit...

This app was so much simpler and even worked better about two years ago and I wish that they'd stop making unnecessary changes and adding convoluted new features and functions that no one asked for  and fix key problems like the constant disconnections.   it's very disappointing  to say the least  that they don't seem to listen to their user base about this. the app isn't very functional and i hate to give it such a low rating  but it really is a bit unusable.","-","1","continually getting worse.",3430414163,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id529814729",4.0.38,0

You‚Äôre better off sticking to the desktop option or looking for an app that‚Äôs more competent than whatever cobbled turdnado of an update this is.   My advice?

"Sdhgvjvjvhbn","At rabb.it that is. I love the app/site & hate it at the same time. I‚Äôve really held off way too long to leave a review. This has been a fairly popular site for a few years and on paper it‚Äôs an awesome idea! But why haven‚Äôt the creators figured it out yet...?  Before the site was difficult for me to navigate  and certain things would take forever to load (trust me it‚Äôs not just my connection).  It had big update recently; haven‚Äôt used the app in maybe a month so I‚Äôm not sure exactly what day it updated.  I actually LIKED the mobile update  cause it was a little more simple to navigate & it allowed me to save log ins.  One complaint about the features is that there‚Äôs no cursor option now  which is okay but I think there will be times that I need it. Also rabb.it does have its own time bar but if I try to rewind or skip  or accidentally click the screen  then it restarts the whole episode and I can‚Äôt fix it.  Now onto my main complaints... THE MOBILE UPDATE IS SO BUGGY. Like one day I couldn‚Äôt even view my logins  they refused to load. Another day NONE of the search bars would work; I‚Äôd try to look up a show I searched before & it wouldn‚Äôt even give any me suggestions.  I couldn‚Äôt enter a URL either  even if it was the homepage of a site that I had just copy & pasted from my browser.  Also I don‚Äôt THINK the mobile version is compatible with the desktop version? Because apparently only mobile  not desktop  has ‚Äúgroups‚Äù which is a new feature it seems. When you click ‚Äúwatch now‚Äù on mobiles  it seems automatically makes a group for you/takes you to the last group you were in  not to your room?? Anyways now the show I‚Äôm watching isn‚Äôt loading correctly  it doesn‚Äôt seem to be starting at the right time  and it only has audio while the screen is all black.... I even restarted my phone and logged in & out. Nothing worked.   I hope no one sees this negative review and thinks I‚Äôm just being senseless. I like rabbit and I thank them so much for giving my friends and I this platform  but it‚Äôs annoyed me a helluva lot. I‚Äôm just being honest not only so rabb.it can improve or fix these problems  but also so people don‚Äôt expect so much from the app and end up hating it.","-","1","I‚Äôm mad for the 100th+ time",3422074507,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id369431252",4.0.38,0

"srn98s","A lot of the functions - photos  calendar  and a private chat - are really nice and enjoyable to use  but I do have an issue with a bug and also the feasibility of the calendar function.  1. For the call function  every time I hit the call button and start a call  if I have to end the call and call again  I cannot start a call through the call buttons (either in chat or by clicking on their profile) unless I restart the app  which I assume resets the button click function. Not sure how the program works but adding a flag for in call may be helpful. Slight bug but causes a slight inconvenience which gets annoying overtime.  2. Also for the call function  it would be nice if there was a video call and hold function  which seem to be pretty standard across social apps.  3. I like the overall idea of the calendar and I think it's pretty awesome to be able to have my events  my so's events  and shared events  but the fact that you cannot import or sync calendars from either apple or google calendars is really inconvenient. I'm surprised that there's an option to export single events  but again  it would be much easier to export the whole calendar as well. I have all my events and tagged logged in my apple/google calendars (about 30-40 events a week)  which also give me appropriate notifications along with travel times. For me to have to manually input each event once again in the Between calendar is a lot of extra time  so I end up not using the function  even though I really enjoy the idea.  I think if these functions were fixed/added  especially the calendar  I would invest in premium  but at this point  the app acts more like a regular messaging app. Although it separates my conversations with one person with the rest  I can also do that with any other messaging app  but only add one friend on it. Overall  pretty good idea but execution needs to be refined more.","-","3","Good idea  but there are flaws that need to be fixed",3523637742,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272520318",5.3.3,0

"Crlaozwyn","UPDATE 9/14: Still no communication from Between or official fixes  but I did find a way to download an old version. 5.2.2 is the last version that actually works. We‚Äôre able to use the app again  but the lack of support (not to mention the issue in the first place!) is unacceptable. Leaving this at 1* until they actually fix the problem.   UPDATE 8/3: 5.3.3 made it WORSE! Previously my partners phone worked correctly. Now BOTH of our devices are saving all sent pictures to the camera roll.   UPDATE 7/10: 5.3.2 still broken. Support still hasn't responded to me. I guess it's only been a month  so...  UPDATE 7/4/18: version 5.3.1 still has the issue. I've done a factory restore and it hasn't helped. I did get a response from the dev - thanking me for my suggestion to automatically save pics to the camera roll  but letting me know that since this is a privacy focused app  they may not implement my idea. My rage knows no bounds.   UPDATE 6/19/18: New version of the app - yay! Issue still exists - booo! First active developer I've ever encountered who ignores support emails and Facebook/Instagram DMs. I never would have bought Plus if I'd known they cared so little.   UPDATE 6/17/18: Three weeks later  the developer is STILL totally MIA. No "we're aware of the issue." No "Can we get more information?" Nothing. I've sent follow up emails. I've tried messaging them on Facebook (their bot just sends you to the same worthless email). The "Report a Problem" link here goes to the same email too. If you're going to have one email  how about actually checking it occassionally?  Original review: As a long time user and recent Between Plus lifetime subscriber  I'm really sad to be writing a one star review. However  I recently discovered something that's a HUGE issue for a privacy app like this. When my partner sends a picture  it automatically saves a copy to the camera roll. This doesn't happen on my phone  nor is there a setting to disable it (that I've found  anyways). I've written to Between support asking for help  but there has been no response. The potential embarrassment of this issue is huge. Fortunately WE found the issue instead of our kids or a friend.   Until this gets fixed  the app is useless to us. There are plenty of other encrypted messenger apps. If the developer cares enough to either fix the issue or respond to my pleas for help (it's only been two weeks of complete silence)  I'll update this review.","-","1","It used to work...",3188438776,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142015904",5.3.3,0

We can also voice call (no video call  sorry!) or chat via the personal message feature. I like the inherent privacy that the app provides... it‚Äôs a special place for just me and my partner!

However  I was very disappointed to open the app after many months of being away from it to find that I must have something against my account. I'm currently a paying member  no access to new members  no access to featured members. Little to no results because I'm not showing up on anyone's radar. This is a fun app when you want someone to talk to and no one is around to text. I've met some great people. I have no idea why my account could be flagged other than the fact that I don't always reply or I have declined a nude photo. I have even spent 2 000 points with the virtual plane tickets to meet more people on here but given my accounts current state that didn't work either.

"LunaKozoku2","Overall the companion app is great  offering many ways to check your stats and weapons as well as checking tasks for weapons and/or dog tags. I started playing battlefield 1 fairly recently enjoyed playing the game greatly with my friends  we even made a platoon together  so when I saw that there was a companion app I was intrigued on what it would offer. While it does have its perks to having for a player I do believe some fixes could be made. For the longest time after getting the app myself and a friend couldn‚Äôt get the emblem creator to properly save the emblems that we had created  after about three weeks of having the app I discovered that I was suddenly able to save the emblem but even after saving the emblem it looked like I hadn‚Äôt made the emblem at all in the screen following tapping on the icon to save the emblem. I was primarily excited about using the companion app for this function so that my friends and I could have some cool emblems but attempting to do so has only brought us frustration.","-","3","Great tool but could use some fixes",3514262361,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id465352294",3.0.4,0

You should add some background music from the battlefield games depending on which tab your on  on this app  I understand that this app can be really helpful (REALLY = in bold) but some music to keep the people using it feel like battlefield will never leave their side and yes of course  your side and my side as well (in a friendly way)!
